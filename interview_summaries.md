# Findings from interviews

## Elizabeth English
- Almost anything that can be elevated can be amphibiated.
- However, she would not recommend tall structures with a narrow base to undergo amphibious treatment. There can be issues with buoyant stability, that's why structures like Statue of Liberty and Washington monument should not be subjected to amphibious treatment (high aspect ratio of height to width).
- Technically it is feasible to amphibiate most buildings, but it may not be cost-effective for all structures.
- Most of her work has been on houses, where the cost of implementing amphibious construction is low.
- She has worked on applying the principles of amphibious construction on *some* landmarks, including the Fansworth House, which has been elevated using rotating trusses. It costed one-fourth the value of the house.
- Structures for which the cost would be lower are buildings that are already elevated, or have a shallow basement that can be flooded. Houses in the historic area of Newport, made of wood and having a shallow basement is a good example. Basement should be deep enough to house the buoyancy blocks.
- FEMA takes a dim view of amphibious construction. They are concerned about this technology getting into the hands of people who want to develop new neighborhoods in wetlands. However, FEMA allows retrofitting of existing houses with amphibious capabilities.
- Base Flood Elevation is the minimum height to which a house must be elevated in order to be eligible for subsidized flood insurance. If somebody decides to go for amphibious construction on his house, then he effectively loses his eligibility to NFIP insurance.
- There is huge amount of interest in this technology in Bangladesh, India, Brazil and Malaysia.
- This can be a cost-effective solution at scale for housing in these countries.
- She is looking for more grants to kickstart new projects.
- The videos in the link show how amphibious construction works: http://buoyantfoundation.org/resources/galleries/videos/
- She is finishing a paper on application of amphibious construction on historic landmarks.
