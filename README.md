# World Heritage Sites and Climate Change

## In a nutshell

Cultural world heritage sites are under threat from climate change. More research is emerging on the vulnerability of these sites, the research community is shifting from risk assessment to a more interdisciplinary social science-y and arguably activist focus on adaptability and management.

## Challenges and options

While the above description is interesting, it does have a certain ‘so what’ aspect to it. It is also more of a topic rather than a specific story. We see 2 ways forward to turn this into a story.

One approach would be to focus on a specific monument and focus on describing it in a specific. The main challenge in that case would
While there are multiple candidates, we haven’t yet

### Findings from interviews
#### Dr. Elizabeth English
- Almost anything that can be elevated can be amphibiated.
- However, she would not recommend tall structures with a narrow base to undergo amphibious treatment. There can be issues with buoyant stability, that's why structures like Statue of Liberty and Washington monument should not be subjected to amphibious treatment (high aspect ratio of height to width).
- Technically it is feasible to amphibiate most buildings, but it may not be cost-effective for all structures.
- Most of her work has been on houses, where the cost of implementing amphibious construction is low. 
- She has worked on applying the principles of amphibious construction on *some* landmarks, including the Fansworth House, which has been elevated using rotating trusses. It costed one-fourth the value of the house.
- Structures for which the cost would be lower are buildings that are already elevated, or have a shallow basement that can be flooded. Houses in the historic area of Newport, made of wood and having a shallow basement is a good example. Basement should be deep enough to house the buoyancy blocks.
- FEMA takes a dim view of amphibious construction. They are concerned about this technology getting into the hands of people who want to develop new neighborhoods in wetlands. However, FEMA allows retrofitting of existing houses with amphibious capabilities.
- Base Flood Elevation is the minimum height to which a house must be elevated in order to be eligible for subsidized flood insurance. If somebody decides to go for amphibious construction on his house, then he effectively loses his eligibility to NFIP insurance.
- There is huge amount of interest in this technology in Bangladesh, India, Brazil and Malaysia.
- This can be a cost-effective solution at scale for housing in these countries.
- She is looking for more grants to kickstart new projects.
- The videos in the link show how amphibious construction works: http://buoyantfoundation.org/resources/galleries/videos/
- She is finishing a paper on application of amphibious construction on historic landmarks.

### Data

- Paper on sea levels in Mediterranean
-

### Data that we have:
    - Data on world heritage sites around the Mediterranean : about erosion and flood risk data from UNESCO
    - Using the data on the location of the sites and their distance from the coastline we can create a visualization on the effects of rising sea levels on the landmarks with respect to the tourists who visit these landmarks. It would be interesting to show how tourist visits to these sites may be affected due to climate change factors. Not only rise in sea levels, but rise in temperatures in these areas can also affect tourism.
    - We have datasets that convey the impact of rising sea levels for these landmarks and the data that shows how temperature change is going the affect the regions where they are located. Using this data we can say something about changing tourism patterns in the coming years.
    - Climate change vulnerability index
    
 ### Alternative angle:
- Looking into research about climate change and world heritage sites, we can say something about the shift in focus of the research papers. After talking to researchers we have learned that research is focussing more on management of cultural sites
- Scholarly interest in the topic of climate change has gone up, as well as the diversity of researchers who are conducting research in this area.
- We hope to do an NLP-based research on the corpus of research papers from different years to see if terms related to climate change are occurring more in the literature. It would also be interesting to see how the diversity of researchers has changed over the years, though that might not be possible using just NLP based techniques.
