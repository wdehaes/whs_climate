# World Heritage Sites and Climate Change

## In a nutshell

Cultural world heritage sites are under threat from climate change. More research is emerging on the vulnerability of these sites, the research community is shifting from risk assessment to a more interdisciplinary social science-y and arguably activist focus on adaptability and management.

## Challenges and options

While the above description is interesting, it does have a certain ‘so what’ aspect to it. It is also more of a topic rather than a specific story. We see 2 ways forward to turn this into a story.

One approach would be to focus on a specific monument and focus on explaining it in an accessible and engaging way to readers. The main challenge in that case is getting access to data.

Alternatively, we could focus on the expanding and changing nature of research into the climate change vulnerability of

### Data

- Paper on sea levels in Mediterranean
-

### Data that we have:
    - Data on world heritage sites around the Mediterranean : about erosion and flood risk data from UNESCO
    - Using the data on the location of the sites and their distance from the coastline we can create a visualization on the effects of rising sea levels on the landmarks with respect to the tourists who visit these landmarks. It would be interesting to show how tourist visits to these sites may be affected due to climate change factors. Not only rise in sea levels, but rise in temperatures in these areas can also affect tourism.
    - We have datasets that convey the impact of rising sea levels for these landmarks and the data that shows how temperature change is going the affect the regions where they are located. Using this data we can say something about changing tourism patterns in the coming years.

 ### Alternative angle:
- Looking into research about climate change and world heritage sites, we can say something about the shift in focus of the research papers. After talking to researchers we have learned that research is focussing more on management of cultural sites
- Scholarly interest in the topic of climate change has gone up, as well as the diversity of researchers who are conducting research in this area.
- We hope to do an NLP-based research on the corpus of research papers from different years to see if terms related to climate change are occurring more in the literature. It would also be interesting to see how the diversity of researchers has changed over the years, though that might not be possible using just NLP based techniques.
