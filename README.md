# World Heritage Sites and Climate Change

## In a nutshell

Cultural world heritage sites are under threat from climate change. More research is emerging on the vulnerability of these sites, the research community is shifting from risk assessment to a more interdisciplinary social science-y and arguably activist focus on adaptability and management.

## Challenges and options

While the above description is interesting, and climate change as a subject remains relevant and important, it is more of a topic rather than a specific story. We see 2 ways forward to turn this into an actual story readers would care about.

### Approach 1: Focus on Word Heritage Sites

One approach would be to focus on a specific monument and focus on explaining it in an accessible and engaging way to readers.

There is a [recent paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06645-9) on World heritage Sites around the Mediterranean under increased risk of flood and erosion. While the paper contains some data visualizations, they are rather limited. However, the underlying [data](https://figshare.com/articles/UNESCO_cultural_World_Heritage_in_the_Mediterranean_coastal_zone/5759538) is readily accessible ([geo-layers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-06645-9#Sec13) as well).

Using the data from the paper I want to show how a traditional tourist trip along these sites may be affected by climate change. In addition to the flood and erosion data from the paper (which the researchers calculated for every decade from 2000 to 2100), I can use temperature predictions to the visualization.

In addition to an interactive map, I want to add information on specific sites from other papers that follow a bottom-up approach, detailing the effects of climate change on individual sites (or a small group of sites in close geographic proximity).


### Approach 2: Focus on the evolution of the research

Based on my interviews with experts as well as some analysis of the body of academic research, there seem to be several trends in the research around climate change and cultural World Heritage Sites:
- the research is expanding, more papers are being published and more scientists are interested in the field
- it seems to become more interdisciplinary and integrated in its approach
- it is expanding its focus from measuring risk and impact to assessing more broadly defined aspects such as vulnerability and adaptability
- researchers are more activist in their assessment and recommendations towards management of these WHS

Drawing inspiration from this [systemic literature review](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-017-1929-9), I can measure the number of papers & researchers involved over time as well as use NLP techniques such as topic modelling on the corpus of research to see if these impressions hold at scale. The final story would combine the result from this analysis with the stories of individual researchers such as Bertolin & Hughes, who cmoe from a very technical 'hard science' background but are now heavily involved in interdisciplinary research into WHS and climate change.
