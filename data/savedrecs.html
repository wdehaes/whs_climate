   encountered while migrating. Fish from populations with more challenging
   migratory environments have greater aerobic scope, larger hearts, and
   better coronary supply. Furthermore, thermal optima for aerobic,

   is characterized by an increasing number of publications from various
   academic disciplines. We conducted a semiquantitative review of
   publications explicitly dealing with cultural ecosystem services. Our
   aims were: (1) to provide an overview of the current state of research,
   (2) to classify the diversity of research approaches by identifying
   clusters of publications that address cultural ecosystem services in
   similar ways, and (3) to highlight some important challenges for the
   future of cultural ecosystem services research. We reviewed 107
   publications and extracted 20 attributes describing their type and
   content, including methods, scales, drivers of change, and trade-offs
   between services. Using a cluster analysis on a subset of attributes we
   identified five groups of publications: Group 1, conceptual focus, deals
   with theoretical issues; Group 2, descriptive reviews, consists mostly
   of desktop studies; Group 3, localized outcomes, deals with case studies
   coming from different disciplines; Group 4, social and participatory,
   deals mainly with assessing preferences and perceptions; and Group 5,
   economic assessments, provides economic valuations. Emerging themes in
   cultural ecosystem services research relate to improving methods for
   cultural ecosystem services valuation, studying cultural ecosystem
   services in the context of ecosystem service bundles, and more clearly
   articulating policy implications. Based on our findings, we conclude
   that: (1) cultural ecosystem services are well placed as a tool to
   bridge gaps between different academic disciplines and research
   communities, (2) capitalizing on the societal relevance of cultural
   ecosystem services could help address real-world problems, and (3)
   cultural ecosystem services have the potential to foster new conceptual
   links between alternative logics relating to a variety of social and
   ecological issues.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Global climate change is predicted to have major negative impacts on
   biodiversity, particularly if important habitat-modifying species
   undergo range shifts. The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii
   (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range expansion to
   relatively cool, macroalgal dominated rocky reefs of eastern Tasmania
   (southeast Australia). As in its historic environment, C. rodgersii in
   the extended range is now found in association with a simplified
   Cybarrens' habitat grazed free of macroalgae. The new and important role
   of this habitat-modifier on reef structure and associated biodiversity
   was clearly demonstrated by completely removing C. rodgersii from
   incipient barrens patches at an eastern Tasmanian site and monitoring
   the macroalgal response relative to unmanipulated barrens patches. In
   barrens patches from which C. rodgersii was removed, there was a rapid
   proliferation of canopy-forming macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and
   Phyllospora comosa), and within 24 months the algal community structure
   had converged with that of adjacent macroalgal beds where C. rodgersii
   grazing was absent. A notable scarcity of limpets on C. rodgersii
   barrens in eastern Tasmania (relative to the historic range) likely
   promotes rapid macroalgal recovery upon removal of the sea urchin. In
   the recovered macroalgal habitat, faunal composition redeveloped similar
   to that from adjacent intact macroalgal beds in terms of total numbers
   of taxa, total individuals and Shannon diversity. In contrast, the
   faunal community of the barrens habitat is overwhelmingly impoverished.
   Of 296 individual floral/faunal taxa recorded, only 72 were present
   within incipient barrens, 253 were present in the recovered patches, and
   221 were present within intact macroalgal beds. Grazing activity of C.
   rodgersii results in an estimated minimum net loss of approximately 150
   taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds in this region.
   Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species
   demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large impacts
   on marine biodiversity as key habitat-modifying species undergo range
   modification.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Global change is challenging plant and animal populations with novel
   environmental conditions, including increased atmospheric CO2
   concentrations, warmer temperatures, and altered precipitation regimes.
   In some cases, contemporary or "rapid" evolution can ameliorate the
   effects of global change. However, the direction and magnitude of
   evolutionary responses may be contingent upon interactions with other
   community members that also are experiencing novel environmental
   conditions. Here, we examine plant adaptation to drought stress in a
   multigeneration experiment that manipulated aboveground-belowground
   feedbacks between plants and soil microbial communities. Although
   drought stress reduced plant growth and accelerated plant phenologies,
   surprisingly, plant evolutionary responses to drought were relatively
   weak. In contrast, plant fitness in both drought and nondrought
   environments was linked strongly to the rapid responses of soil
   microbial community structure to moisture manipulations. Specifically,
   plants were most fit when their contemporary environmental conditions
   (wet vs. dry soil) matched the historical environmental conditions (wet
   vs. dry soil) of their associated microbial community. Together, our
   findings suggest that, when faced with environmental change, plants may
   not be limited to "adapt or migrate" strategies; instead, they also may
   benefit from association with interacting species, especially diverse
   soil microbial communities, that respond rapidly to environmental
   change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Sundarban, covering about one million ha in the delta of the rivers
   Ganga, Brahmaputra and Meghna is shared between Bangladesh (similar to
   60%) and India (similar to 40%), and is the world's largest coastal
   wetland. The area experiences a subtropical monsoonal climate with an
   annual rainfall of 1,600-1,800 mm and severe cyclonic storms. Enormous
   amounts of sediments carried by the rivers contribute to its expansion
   and dynamics. Salinity gradients change over a wide range of spatial and
   temporal scales. The biodiversity includes about 350 species of vascular
   plants, 250 fishes and 300 birds, besides numerous species of
   phytoplankton, fungi, bacteria, zooplankton, benthic invertebrates,
   molluscs, reptiles, amphibians and mammals. Species composition and
   community structure vary east to west, and along the hydrological and
   salinity gradients. Sundarban is the habitat of many rare and endangered
   animals (Batagur baska, Pelochelys bibroni, Chelonia mydas), especially
   the Royal Bengal tiger (Panthera tigris). Javan rhino, wild buffalo, hog
   deer, and barking deer are now extinct from the area. Large areas of the
   Sundarban mangroves have been converted into paddy fields over the past
   two centuries, and more recently into shrimp farms. The Sundarban has
   been extensively exploited for timber, fish, prawns and fodder. The
   regulation of river flows by a series of dams, barrages and embankments
   for diverting water upstream for various human needs and for flood
   control has caused large reduction in freshwater inflow and seriously
   affected the biodiversity because of an increase in salinity and changes
   in sedimentation. Heritiera fomes (locally called Sundari, from which
   Sundarban derives its name), Nypa fruticans and Phoenix paludosa are
   declining rapidly. During the past three decades, large parts of the
   remaining Sundarban have been protected for wildlife, particularly
   tiger, through the creation of several sanctuaries and a biosphere
   reserve. Parts of the Sundarban in both India and Bangladesh have been
   declared World Heritage sites. However, its biodiversity continues to be
   threatened by a growing human population that not only places pressure
   on its biological resources, but also impacts on the freshwater inflows
   from upstream areas. Oil exploration in coastal areas is also emerging
   as a new threat. Further threats arise from global climate change,
   especially sea level rise. The future of the Sundarban will depend upon
   the management of freshwater resources as much as on the conservation of
   its biological resources.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A new global coastal database has been developed within the context of
   the DINAS-COAST project. The database covers the world's coasts,
   excluding Antarctica, and includes information on more than 80 physical,
   ecological, and socioeconomic parameters of the coastal zone. The
   database provides the base data for the Dynamic Interactive
   Vulnerability Assessment modelling tool that the DINAS-COAST project has
   produced. In order to comply with the requirements of the modelling
   tool, it is based on a data model in which all information is referenced
   to more than 12,000 linear coastal segments of variable length. For
   efficiency of data storage, six other geographic features
   (administrative units, countries, rivers, tidal basins or estuaries,
   world heritage sites, and climate grid cells) are used to reference some
   data, but all are linked to the linear segment structure. This
   fundamental linear data structure is unique for a global database and
   represents an efficient solution to the problem of representing and
   storing coastal data. The database has been specifically designed to
   support impact and vulnerability analysis to sea-level rise at a range
   of scales up to global. Due to the structure, consistency,
   user-friendliness, and wealth of information in the database, it has
   potential wider application to analysis and modelling of the world's
   coasts, especially at regional to global scales.</td>

   population dynamics model to the NEMURO lower trophic level
   nutrient-phytoplankton-zooplankton model. The coupled models, denoted
   NEMURO.FISH and configured for Pacific herring (Clupea harengus
   pallasii) on the west coast of Vancouver island, are capable of
   simulating the daily dynamics of the lower trophic levels and the daily
   average weight and numbers of individual herring in each of 10 age
   classes over multiple years. New recruits to the herring population are
   added each June based on either constant recruitment or dynamic
   recruitment generated from an environmental Ricker spawner-recruitment
   relationship. The dynamics of the three zooplankton groups in the NEMURO
   model determine the consumption rate of the herring; herring consumption
   affects the zooplankton, and egestion and excretion contribute to the
   nitrogen dynamics. NEMURO was previously calibrated to field data for
   the West Coast Vancouver Island. Thirty-year simulations of herring
   growth and population dynamics were performed that used repeated
   environmental conditions for the lower trophic levels of NEMURO and
   historical environmental variables for the herring spawner-recruit
   relationship. Herring dynamics were calibrated to the west coast of
   Vancouver Island such that the coupled models reasonably duplicated
   observed herring weights-at-age and total herring biomass. Additional
   30-year simulations under constant recruitment with herring coupled and
   uncoupled from NEMURO clearly showed the effects of the feedback
   mechanism between the two models and also showed that herring have small
   to moderate effects on their prey. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis
   showed the importance of feeding- and respiration-related parameters to
   predicted individual and population herring growth. The utility of the
   NEMURO.FISH framework for improving our understanding of climate change
   effects on marine ecosystem dynamics is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier

   policy levels. However, it is usually explored in terms of its effect on
   agriculture, water, industry, energy, transport and health and as yet
   has been insufficiently addressed as a factor threatening cultural
   heritage. Among the climate parameters critical to heritage conservation
   and expected to change in the future, precipitation plays an important
   role in surface recession of stone. The Lipfert function has been taken
   under consideration to quantify the annual surface recession of
   carbonate stone, due to the effects of clean rain, acid rain and dry
   deposition of pollutants. The present paper provides Europe-wide maps
   showing quantitative predictions of surface recession on carbonate
   stones for the 21st century, combining a modified Lipfert function with
   output from the Hadley global climate model. Chemical dissolution of
   carbonate stones, via the karst effect, will increase with future CO2
   concentrations, and will come to dominate over sulfur deposition and
   acid rain effects on monuments and buildings in both urban and rural
   areas. During the present century the rainfall contribution to surface
   recession is likely to have a small effect, while the increase in
   atmospheric CO2 concentration is shown to be the main factor in
   increasing weathering via the karst effect. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

   perspectives to understand how populations persisted during past periods
   of unfavorable climate. Recently, researchers have applied the idea to
   contemporary landscapes to identify climate change refugia, here defined
   as areas relatively buffered from contemporary climate change over time
   that enable persistence of valued physical, ecological, and
   socio-cultural resources. We differentiate historical and contemporary
   views, and characterize physical and ecological processes that create
   and maintain climate change refugia. We then delineate how refugia can
   fit into existing decision support frameworks for climate adaptation and
   describe seven steps for managing them. Finally, we identify challenges
   and opportunities for operationalizing the concept of climate change
   refugia. Managing climate change refugia can be an important option for
   conservation in the face of ongoing climate change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>How soil processes such as carbon cycling will respond to future climate
   change depends on the responses of complex microbial communities, but
   most ecosystem models assume that microbial functional responses are
   resilient and can be predicted from simple parameters such as biomass
   and temperature. Here, we consider how historical contingencies might
   alter those responses because function depends on prior conditions or
   biota. Functional resilience can be driven by physiological, community
   or adaptive shifts; historical contingencies can result from the
   influence of historical environments or a combination of priority
   effects and biotic resistance. By modelling microbial population
   responses to environmental change, we demonstrate that historical
   environments can constrain soil function with the degree of constraint
   depending on the magnitude of change in the context of the prior
   environment. For example microbial assemblages from more constant
   environments were more sensitive to change leading to poorer functional
   acclimatisation compared to microbial assemblages from more fluctuating
   environments. Such historical contingencies can lead to deviations from
   expected functional responses to climate change as well as local
   variability in those responses. Our results form a set of interrelated
   hypotheses regarding soil microbial responses to climate change that
   warrant future empirical attention.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Sierra Nevada of southern Spain is a landscape with a rich
   biological and cultural heritage. The range was extensively glaciated
   during the late Pleistocene. However, the postglacial paleoecologic
   history of the highest range in southern Europe is nearly completely
   unknown. Here we use sediments from a small lake above present treeline
   - Laguna de Rio Seco at 3020 m elevation - in a paleoecological study
   documenting over 11,500 calendar years of vegetation, fire and climate
   change, addressing ecological and paleoclimatic issues unique to this
   area through comparison with regional paleoecological sequences. The
   early record is dominated by Pinus pollen, with Betula, deciduous
   Quercus, and grasses, with an understory of shrubs. It is unlikely that
   pine trees grew around the lake, and fire was relatively unimportant at
   this site during this period. Aquatic microfossils indicate that the
   wettest conditions and highest lake levels at Laguna de Rio Seco
   occurred before 7800 cal yr BR This is in contrast to lower elevation
   sites, where wettest conditions occurred after ca 7800. Greater
   differences in early Holocene seasonal insolation may have translated to
   greater snowpack and subsequently higher lake levels at higher
   elevations, but not necessarily at lower elevations, where higher
   evaporation rates prevailed. With declining seasonality after ca 8000
   cal yr BP, but continuing summer precipitation, lake levels at the
   highest elevation site remained high, but lake levels at lower elevation
   sites increased as evaporation rates declined. Drier conditions
   commenced regionally after ca 5700 cal yr BP, shown at Laguna de Rio
   Seco by declines in wetland pollen, and increases in high elevation
   steppe shrubs common today (Juniperus. Artemisia, and others). The
   disappearance or decline of mesophytes, such as Betula from ca 4000 cal
   yr BP is part of a regional depletion in Mediterranean Spain and
   elsewhere in Europe from the mid to late Holocene. On the other hand,
   Castanea sativa increased in Laguna de Rio Seco record after ca 4000 cal
   yr BP, and especially in post-Roman times, probably due to
   arboriculture. Though not as important at high than at low elevations,
   fire occurrence was elevated, particularly after ca 3700 years ago, in
   response to regional human population expansion. The local and regional
   impact of humans increased substantially after ca 2700 years ago, with
   the loss of Pinus forest within the mountain range, increases in
   evidence of pasturing herbivores around the lake, and Olea cultivation
   at lower elevations. Though human impact was not as extensive at high
   elevation as at lower elevation sites in southern Iberia, this record
   confirms that even remote sites were not free of direct human influence
   during the Holocene. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In climate change discourse the concept of anticipatory adaptation has
   emerged to refer to proactive strategies for preparing communities for
   future change. This paper makes a proposal for what might be called
   anticipatory history. At designated heritage sites prevailing narratives
   tend to project long-term conservation indefinitely forward into the
   future. These narrative formulations fall short when confronted with the
   impending transformation, or even disappearance, of landscapes and
   artefacts of cultural heritage - a process that is likely to become
   increasingly common with the acceleration of environmental change in
   coastal and other contexts. Might it be possible to experiment with
   other ways of storying landscape, framing histories around movement
   rather than stasis, and drawing connections between past dynamism and
   future process? At the core of this paper is an experimental narration
   of the history of a Cornish harbour. The narrative presents a reverse
   chronology of moments gleaned from diverse sources ranging over three
   centuries, looking to a fractured landscape past to find resources for
   encountering a future unmaking.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This work aims to predict the evolution in freezing processes due to
   climate change during the 21st century and the potential damage to
   historic structures and archaeological remains in Europe. We have
   developed a range of techniques to convert climate data into parameters
   related to the freeze-thaw processes and study their progression within
   the A2 scenario using the Hadley HadCM3 Model, from 1961 to 2099.
   Freezing and thawing is important because it represents a process where
   a phase change occurs at an exact temperature. A few degrees change in
   temperature or small percentages change in precipitation amount do not
   initially seem to present a threat to materials. However, freeze-thaw
   events occur at fixed temperature, so the effects of small temperature
   changes can be amplified. Our results suggest that much of temperate
   Europe will see a significantly reduced incidence of freezing in the
   future. This should mean that porous stone typically used in the
   monuments of temperate areas may be less vulnerable to frost damage in
   the future. Warmer temperatures in the far north look set to affect
   archaeological sites that have been preserved in the permafrost. These
   changes may also affect the foundations of structures and induce
   landslides. Exploring the range of possible changes allows us to
   contemplate appropriate contingencies and support strategic decision
   making by heritage managers. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

   such as in Kiribati, formal national adaptation programmes are currently
   being operationalised. A key focus is enhancing the adaptive capacity of
   vulnerable communities through piloting of sectoral adaptation
   strategies such as diversifying water resources. This study argues that
   fundamental to water management and adaptation planning is the
   integration of people's cultural values attached to the assets/resources
   they control and utilise in their efforts to adapt to various stresses
   on water resources. The results from integrating cultural resources into
   a Sustainable Livelihoods Framework indicate that people's capacity to
   diversify is constrained by cultural processes negotiated in their daily
   lives that reinforced and reproduced hardships. Material resources
   provided personal significance when they were spent on maintaining
   social identity, expressed in recent times through the church. Thus
   fewer resources were available for pursuing a diversification strategy.
   Furthermore, power structures in the church delimited benefits to the
   individual, depriving people of their freedom to exercise autonomous
   agency and achieve personal wellbeing. The study demonstrates the
   significance of religion to adaptation. Moreover, it highlights the need
   to consider the relational aspects of assets, in conditioning how people
   access and utilise assets in pursuing adaptation strategies. (C) 2009

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent environmental change in Lake Baikal has been attributed to
   anthropogenic influences on the ecosystem, especially through pollution
   and cultural eutrophication. These hypotheses are tested in this paper
   principally by diatom analyses in 20 short sediment cores. Most of the
   cores were collected with a new type of box corer specifically designed
   for use on Lake Baikal. Most cores contain a good sediment record but
   turbidites occur in some sediment profiles which may he best recognized
   using a combination of techniques, such as radiometric dating and
   percentage dry weight analyses. The most recent sediments, especially
   those in the southern basin and in the very north of Baikal, contain a
   record of anthropogenic contamination in the form of lead and spheroidal
   carbonaceous particles, which confirms that the southern basin of Baikal
   is most affected by atmospheric sources of pollution. However, there is
   no sedimentary diatom evidence indicating offshore water quality
   deterioration in Baikal owing to air pollution or eutrophication. Small
   increases in diatoms which indicate nutrient enrichment (e.g.
   Stephanodiscus minutulus, Synedra acus v. radians and Synedra acus v.
   acus) may reflect local eutrophication of the shallow waters close to
   the Selenga Delta and certain coastal sites in the southern basin near
   to the Baikalsk paper and pulp mill. By using numerical techniques, Lake
   Baikal can be split into at least four regions on the basis of its
   surface sediment flora: the south, middle and north basins, and the
   shallow waters surrounding the Selenga Delta region. Diatom analyses
   reveal that the endemic flora of Lake Baikal has been constantly
   changing over at least the last 2000 years and that these fluctuations
   are probably responses to natural climatic variability. Recent sediments
   of Baikal may be affected by taphonomic processes (e.g. dissolution) and
   turbidite deposition, and these must be taken into account when
   interpreting the sedimentary diatom record.The diatom flora of the lake
   is currently dominated by several species, such as Aulacoseira
   baicalensis, A, islandica, Cyclotella minuta and Stephanodiscus
   binderanus v. baicalensis. All these species, except for C. minuta, have
   become more common in the lake in approximately the last 130 years, and
   we hypothesize that these changes may be attributed to a number of
   different processes linked to an ameliorating climate after the end of
   the Little Ice Age. The results presented here have important
   implications for this recently designated World Heritage Site, with
   regard to future pollution controls and catchment management policies.</td>

   and aquatic amphibians) and investigate the environmental factors
   driving these patterns at the river drainage basin grain. We find that
   species richness and endemism patterns are significantly correlated

   induced by common responses of taxa to their contemporary and historical
   environments (i.e. convergent patterns). Apart from some taxa
   distinctiveness (i.e. fishes), the climate/productivity' hypothesis is
   found to explain the greatest variance in species richness and endemism
   patterns, followed by factors related to the history/dispersion' and
   area/environmental heterogeneity' hypotheses. As aquatic amphibians
   display the highest levels of congruency with other taxa, this taxon

   record of South America was viewed uncritically as a uniform and
   unilinear development involving the intrusion of North American people
   who brought a founding cultural heritage, the fluted Clovis stone tool
   technology, and a big-game hunting tradition to the southern hemisphere
   between 11,000 and 10,000 years ago.(1-3) Biases in the history of
   research and the agendas pursued in the archeology of the first
   Americans have played a major part in forming this
   perspective.(4-6)Despite enthusiastic acceptance of the Clovis model by
   a vast majority of archeologists, several South American specialists
   have rejected it.(6-11) They contend that the presence of archeological
   sites in Tierra del Fuego and other regions by at least 11,000 to 10,500
   years ago was simply insufficient time for even the fastest migration of
   North Americans to reach within only a few hundred years. Despite this
   concern, and despite the discovery of several pre-Clovis sites in South
   America,(6,10-12) some specialists(2,3) keep the Clovis model alive.
   Proponents of the model claim that the pre-Clovis sites are unreliable
   due to questionable radiocarbon dates, artifacts, and stratigraphy.
   Solid evidence at the Monte Verde site in Chile(14-16) and other
   localities(6,8,10-12) now indicates that South America was discovered by
   humans at least 12,500 years ago. How much earlier than 12,500 years ago
   is still a matter of conjecture.(6,10,12,15) Some proponents prefer a
   long chronology of 20,000 to 45,000 years ago,(8) while others advocate
   a short chronology of 15,000 to 20,000 years ago(10-12) or only 11,000
   years ago.(1-3).</td>

   public acceptance of sustainable energy transitions in terms of values
   and a 'whole-system' lens. This assertion is based on findings arising
   from a major research project examining public values, attitudes and
   acceptability with regards to whole energy system change using a
   mixed-method (six deliberative workshops, n=68, and a nationally
   representative survey, n = 2441), interdisciplinary approach. Through
   the research we identify a set of social values associated with
   desirable energy futures in the UK, where the values represent
   identifiable cultural resources people draw on to guide their preference
   formation about particular aspects of energy system change. As such, we
   characterise public perspectives as being underpinned by six value
   clusters relating to efficiency and wastefulness, environment and
   nature, security and stability, social justice and fairness, autonomy
   and power, and processes and change. We argue that this 'value system'
   provides a basis for understanding core reasons for public acceptance or
   rejection of different energy system aspects and processes. We conclude
   that a focus on values that underpin more specific preferences for
   energy system change brings insights that could provide a basis for
   improved dialogue, more robust decision-making, and for anticipating
   likely points of conflict in energy transitions. (C) 2015 The Authors.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In many developing regions of Melanesia, fishers' traditional ecological
   knowledge (TEK) has been integrated with western science and management
   knowledge (SMK) to generate innovative and effective fisheries
   management. Previous research suggests that three factors initiate this
   process: depleted fishery stocks, limited SMK, and ownership of
   resources by local communities. In other contexts the extent of
   power-sharing through comanagement, and the cultural significance of
   species may also be important determinants of knowledge integration.
   Here we assess the role of these factors in the application of TEK in
   the Torres Strait Islands, Australia, where commercial and subsistence
   fisheries are fundamental to the Indigenous Melanesian culture and
   livelihoods. In 2009 we surveyed fishery managers and scientists who
   revealed that TEK had only been recently and sparingly applied in four
   fisheries (turtle, dugong, lobster, and hand collectables), and only two
   of the seven species concerned had a combination of depleted stocks, low
   SMK, and high community ownership. Instead, comanagement characteristics
   and the cultural value of species were the primary determinants of TEK
   application. We suggest that turtles and dugong are cultural keystone
   species that simultaneously provide important ecosystem services to both
   islanders' livelihoods and international conservation interests.
   Combined with their ecological scale these species have catalyzed
   comanagement between indigenous and government stakeholders,
   precipitating the application of TEK in other fisheries of lesser
   cultural importance. We discuss modifications to governance required to
   enable knowledge integration to evolve further through adaptive
   comanagement, and its role in enhancing fisheries management and thus
   the resilience of the Torres Strait social-ecological system. Our study
   highlights the potential utility of cultural keystone species in
   stimulating cross-cultural resource governance in developed economies
   such as Australia.</td>

   museum collections that are housed in historic buildings. Changes of the
   indoor environment in the building affect the microclimate around the
   museum objects and may cause damage to the collection. In this study, a
   method is proposed to assess the damage risk of future climate change to
   museum objects in historic buildings. The method is applied for two
   historic museum buildings in The Netherlands and Belgium. The impact of
   climate change on the indoor environment of the buildings is analysed by
   combining weather data from a future outdoor climate scenario with an
   indoor climate simulation model. Two museum rooms in each building,
   containing collections of historic paintings and wooden furniture, are
   modelled. The predicted indoor environment from 1950 until 2099 in the
   four museum rooms is assessed based on the ASHRAE guidelines for indoor
   conditions related to museum collections. In addition, the potential
   damage risk of climate change to two typical museum objects is
   investigated. For the examined case studies, it is found that the
   expected climate change considerably increases both indoor temperature
   and relative humidity. Of these two factors, the rising relative
   humidity has the highest impact on the damage potential for museum
   objects. Based on the results of the proposed method, it is expected
   that future climate change in historic buildings may in some cases
   increase mould growth, but may not have a significant impact on
   mechanical degradation of objects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   last sixty years, and especially since 1990, a substantial portfolio of
   geoconservation sites, legislation, partnerships and initiatives has
   developed within the UK and internationally. This includes local,
   national and international geoconservation audits, suites of protected
   sites such as Local Geological Sites, Sites of Special Scientific

   legislation, policies, frameworks and guidance, partnerships, groups,
   societies and associations, periodicals and magazines, regular

   geoconservation activities. This portfolio is an extremely valuable
   resource for science and society, creating opportunities for research,
   education, training, and recreation and providing 'windows' through
   which to study and understand past environmental change and thus inform
   planning to accommodate future change. The current social, economic and
   environmental context means that the approach to geoconservation must
   evolve to embrace new challenges and opportunities including the
   ecosystem approach, adapting to climate change, increasing the relevance
   of geodiversity to local communities and operating in a financially

   innovation and full engagement with new opportunities, but in so doing,

   of many terrestrial and marine species. Marine phytoplankton communities
   appear sensitive to climate change, yet understanding of how individual
   species may respond to anthropogenic climate change remains limited.
   Here, using historical environmental and phytoplankton observations, we
   characterize the realized ecological niches for 87 North Atlantic diatom
   and dinoflagellate taxa and project changes in species biogeography
   between mean historical (1951-2000) and future (2051-2100) ocean
   conditions. We find that the central positions of the core range of 74%
   of taxa shift poleward at a median rate of 12.9 kmper decade
   (km.dec(-1)), and 90% of taxa shift eastward at a median rate of 42.7
   km.dec(-1). The poleward shift is faster than previously reported for
   marine taxa, and the predominance of longitudinal shifts is driven by
   dynamic changes in multiple environmental drivers, rather than a
   strictly poleward, temperature-driven redistribution of ocean habitats.
   A century of climate change significantly shuffles community composition
   by a basin-wide median value of 16%, compared with seasonal variations
   of 46%. The North Atlantic phytoplankton community appears poised for
   marked shift and shuffle, which may have broad effects on food webs and
   biogeochemical cycles.</td>

   forest by moorland during the mid to late Holocene in western Tasmania,
   Australia.LocationWestern Tasmania, Australia.MethodsFossil pollen data
   were screened with a modern pollen dataset using detrended
   correspondence analysis and charcoal data were analysed using
   significance tests.ResultsAt the landscape scale, the distribution of
   vegetation types in western Tasmania has remained remarkably stable
   through the post-glacial period. Open moorland has dominated the
   landscape since the Late Glacial, while rain forest expanded at that
   time in to areas which it occupies today. Vegetation development in the
   Holocene is markedly different and charcoal values are significantly
   higher when compared with those in previous interglacial periods.Main
   conclusionsThe dominant paradigm of a replacement of rain forest by
   moorland across western Tasmania during the mid to late Holocene is not
   supported by this regional analysis. The arrival of humans in Tasmania
   during the Last Glacial Stage provided an ignition source that was
   independent of climate, and burning by humans through the Late Glacial
   period deflected vegetation development and facilitated the
   establishment of open moorland in regions occupied by rain forest during
   previous interglacial periods. It is concluded that the present
   dominance of the landscape of western Tasmania by open moorland is the
   direct result of human activity during the Late Glacial and that this
   region represents an ancient cultural landscape.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The role of species diversity on ecosystem resistance in the face of
   strong environmental fluctuations has been addressed from both
   theoretical and experimental viewpoints to reveal a variety of positive
   and negative relationships. Here we explore empirically the relationship
   between the richness of forest woody species and canopy resistance to
   extreme drought episodes. We compare richness data from an extensive
   forest inventory to a temporal series of satellite imagery that
   estimated drought impact on forest canopy as NDVI (normalized difference
   vegetation index) anomalies of the dry summer in 2003 in relation to
   records of previous years. We considered five different types of forests
   that are representative of the main climatic and altitudinal gradients
   of the region, ranging from lowland Mediterranean to mountain
   boreal-temperate climates.The observed relationship differed among
   forest types and interacted with the climate, summarised by the
   Thorntwaite index. In Mediterranean Pinus halepensis forests, NDVI
   decreased during the drought. This decrease was stronger in forests with
   lower richness. In Mediterranean evergreen forests of Quercus ilex,
   drought did not result in an overall NDVI loss, but lower NDVI values
   we're observed in drier localities with lower richness, and in more
   moist localities with higher number of species. In mountain Pinus
   sylvestris forests NDVI decreased, mostly due to the drought impact on
   drier localities, while no relation to species richness was observed. In
   moist Fagus sylvatica forests, NDVI only decreased in plots with high
   richness. No effect of drought was observed in the high mountain Pinus
   uncinata forests.Our results show that a shift on the
   diversity-stability relationship appears across the regional, climatic
   gradient. A positive relationship appears in drier localities,
   supporting a null model where the probability of finding a species able
   to cope with drier conditions increases with the number of species.
   However, in more moist localities we hypothesize that the proportion of
   drought-sensitive species would increase in richer localities, due to a
   higher likelihood of co-occurrence of species that share moist climatic
   requirements. The study points to the convenience of considering the
   causes of disturbance in relation to current environmental gradients and
   historical environmental constraints on the community.</td>

   can be found in developing countries, but many of them are in a bad
   state. Thus, there is a need to document the social benefits of these
   global goods in order to justify the costs of restoration and
   preservation programmes (RPPs). This study adds to the scarce literature
   on economic benefits of WHSs in developing countries, and reduces the
   need to perform very uncertain benefit transfers from European or US
   valuation studies. We apply Contingent Valuation (CV) and Choice
   Modelling (CM) to estimate the social benefits of RPPs for the My Son
   world cultural heritage site in Vietnam; both to foreign visitors and
   the local residents. We then compare the estimates from the CV and CM
   methods, and pool the results from the two methods. The results show
   that both CV and CM are suited to estimating the economic benefits of
   preserving cultural heritage of My Son. The two methods produce very
   similar results, which can be interpreted as a test of convergence
   validity. The pooling results give evidence to show that the CV and CM
   models have the same underlying preference structures. Thus, these
   valuation models can be successfully used in cost-benefit analyses to
   assess the benefits to cultural heritage of measures to reduce air
   pollution, soil erosion, climate change and other causes to
   deterioration of cultural heritage sites.</td>

   heritage sites will be affected by sea-level rise at different levels of
   sustained future warming. As indicators for the pressure on future

   loss, and the percentage of current population living in regions that
   will be permanently below sea level, for different temperature levels.
   If the current global mean temperature was sustained for the next two
   millennia, about 6% (40 sites) of the UNESCO sites will be affected, and
   0.7% of global land area will be below mean sea level. These numbers
   increase to 19% (136 sites) and 1.1% for a warming of 3 K. At this
   warming level, 3-12 countries will experience a loss of more than half
   of their current land surface, 25-36 countries lose at least 10% of
   their territory, and 7% of the global population currently lives in

   stalagmite, and two animal dung deposits, is longer and more detailed
   for the end of the Pleistocene than previous palynological reports from
   the southern Kalahari region. This pollen record closely matches
   information from spring peats at Wonderkrater in Northern Province
   indicating that speleothem pollen can provide reliable paleovegetation
   data. The delta O-18 and delta C-13 records resemble those from Cold Air
   Cave in Northern Province and parallel variations in Greenland Ice Sheet
   GISP2 paleotemperature. This indicates that past climate changes in
   southern Africa were linked to changes in global atmospheric and oceanic
   circulation patterns possibly triggered by conditions in the North
   Atlantic region. The Wonderwerk data suggest wetter conditions at ca. 33
   ka, from 23 to 17 ka, and from 4 ka to present. Conditions were drier
   17-13 ka, when microstromatolitic carbonate was deposited on the flank
   of the stalagmite, and possibly also during depositional hiatuses from

   Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador, including World Heritage sites
   at Galapagos, Coiba, Cocos and MalpeloMethods Densities of reef fishes,
   mobile and sessile invertebrates, and macroalgae were quantified using
   underwater visual surveys at 136 'no-take' and 54 openly fished sites
   associated with seven large MPAs that encompassed a range of management
   strategies. Spatial variation inmultivariate and univariate community
   metrics was related to three levels of fishing pressure (high-protection
   MPAs, limited-protection MPAs, fishing zones) for both continental and
   oceanic reefs.Results High-protection MPAs possessed a much greater
   biomass of higher carnivorous fishes, lower densities of asteroids and
   Eucidaris spp. urchins, and higher coral cover than limited-protection
   MPAs and fished zones. These results were generally consistent with the
   hypothesis that overfishing of predatory fishes within the ETP has led
   to increased densities of habitat-modifying macroinvertebrates, which
   has contributed to regional declines in coral cover. Major differences
   in ecological patterns were also evident between continental and oceanic
   biogeographic provinces.Main conclusions Fishing down the food web, with
   associated trophic cascades, has occurred to a greater extent along the
   continental coast than off oceanic islands. Poorly enforced MPAs

   Estimates of full-Wisconsin elevational depression of alpine permafrost
   and vegetation zones support the existence of glacial-maximum dispersal
   corridors between currently isolated populations of O. princeps.
   Altithermal warming accounts for 66.7% of apparent post-Wisconsin
   extinctions of insular populations of pikas in the region. Populations
   at sites with altithermal refugia &gt; 100 km(2) enjoyed high survivorship
   (93.8%) compared to smaller refugia (6.1-15.2%). Extant populations are
   located within 5 km of current alpine permafrost and within 20 km of the
   estimated altithermal occurrence of permafrost, indicating minor
   subsequent dispersal from a more restricted distribution of 6000 yr ago.
   Recolonization of sites within 20 km has been rare (less than or equal
   to 7.8%). Depending on the time scale considered, pikas are either
   expanding their range in response to regional cooling (100,000-yr and
   1000-yr scale) or retreating in the face of regional warming (10,000-yr
   and 100-yr scale), which in mesic habitat results in filling of taluses
   by vegetation encroachment and soil formation.</td>

   ecosystems in human-dominated landscapes. However, existing protected
   areas represent only relatively small, geographically biased samples of
   species and habitats. Climate change and habitat loss can exacerbate
   these biases and the net result is a small, skewed subset of historic
   environmental conditions. We developed a general model to improve the
   representation of environmental conditions across the range of at-risk
   species or any other elements targeted for conservation. We implemented
   the model as an integer linear-programming problem to select additional
   areas to complement existing reserves and create new portfolios that are
   bioclimatically representative across a range of climatic scenarios. We
   demonstrated the use of the model for a small dataset including two
   hydrologic variables across the range of five species of fairy shrimp
   (Anostraca) in the Central Valley ecoregion of California, USA under
   three climate scenarios. The bioclimatic representation model identified
   solutions that meet biodiversity representation goals and substantially
   improve bioclimatic representation at minimal additional cost in terms
   of total land selected for a conservation portfolio. Additional
   constraints rewarding bioclimatic representation under two conflicting
   climate scenarios resulted in only a small decrease in the performance
   of solutions with respect to current climate. We conclude that this
   model provides a general tool for improving bioclimatic representation,
   and results from the Central Valley case study suggest an encouraging,
   testable hypothesis that climatically robust bioclimatic representation
   can be achieved at negligible marginal costs. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

   media such as soil, rock and concrete. Climate change can expose new
   regions and subject others to a changing freeze-thaw frequency.
   Therefore, understanding and predicting the effect of freeze-thaw cycles
   is important in environmental science, the built environment and
   cultural heritage preservation. In this paper, we explore the
   possibilities of state-of-the-art micro-CT in studying the pore scale
   dynamics related to freezing and thawing. The experiments show the
   development of a fracture network in a porous limestone when cooling to
   -9.7 degrees C, at which an exothermal temperature peak is a proxy for
   ice crystallization. The dynamics of the fracture network are visualized
   with a time frame of 80 s. Theoretical assumptions predict that
   crystallization in these experiments occurs in pores of 6-20.1 nm under
   transient conditions. Here, the crystallization-induced stress exceeds
   rock strength when the local crystal fraction in the pores is 4.3%. The
   location of fractures is strongly related to preferential water uptake
   paths and rock texture, which are visually identified. Laboratory,
   continuous X-ray micro-CT scanning opens new perspectives for the
   pore-scale study of ice crystallization in porous media as well as for
   environmental processes related to freeze-thaw fracturing.</td>

   history, the natural environment, and climate through the Holocene, has
   frequently stalled because of controversy concerning certain key
   volcanic eruptions and their precise relationships with the
   archaeological/environmental record. A major stumbling block in such
   debates is a failure to obtain precise and accurate dates for many of
   these key volcanic events. Most existing dates currently float against
   archaeological, historical, environmental, and climate data. A potential
   means to resolution lies with tree rings: these can be dated precisely
   by dendrochronology, are available from a wide range of loci around the
   world, and can record global climatic influences. It has been suggested
   that certain growth anomalies in dendrochronological sequences could
   offer "proxy" absolutely dated records of major, climatically effective,
   volcanic eruptions. However, this assertion has been widely disputed
   given the lack of a direct, positive, causal connection. The hypothesis
   that the required connection may be chemically encoded in individual
   annual growth rings from dated sequences is explored here both via
   review of existing literature on dendrochemical techniques, and by
   LA-ICP-MS chemical analysis of two tree ring sequences. It is concluded
   that dendrochemistry provides a promising means by which absolute dates
   may one day be attributed to key volcanic eruptions of pre-modern times.

   Retrofitting these buildings is a complex balancing act, in which many
   criteria are balanced against-one another Morder Machieve continued,
   long-term use of the building. This article reviews the criteria,
   analysis methods, and decision making processes used to assess energy
   retrofits in historic and traditional buildings. First, the criteria are
   discussed. While energy consumption and conservation are the dominant
   criteria, a number of others are also important, including the needs of
   the building fabric, occupants, and collections, as well as economics,
   embodied energy, and climate change. Second, several analysis methods
   for estimating or measuring retrofit performance have emerged as
   particularly useful for historic and traditional'buildings, and these
   are examined. Third, recent efforts to develop consistent guidance and
   decision-making processes for selecting retrofits are reviewed. Overall,
   energy retrofits in these buildings are seen not only as a way to reduce
   energy consumption, but as a means of preserving them for future

   encourage liveability and sustainable development of cities in the
   context of global climate change. It is a complex process that serves
   diverse perspectives, among them is the thermal comfort. The paper
   analyze the contribution of street configuration towards the improvement
   of thermal comfort at pedestrian level, in the Old Town of Camaguey-Cuba
   (World Heritage Site, since 2008). Simulations performed are run for
   summer and winter solstices by using RayMan model. The urban settings
   are represented by symmetrical street canyons (380 m long, 9 m width),
   with different solar orientations (i.e. N-S, NE-SW, E-W, NW-SE) and
   aspect ratios (i.e. H/W = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5). Results are
   presented in terms of Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET). Our
   findings confirm that the spatial distribution of thermal conditions at
   street level, depend strongly on aspect ratio and street orientation.
   The results show extreme patterns of thermal comfort between N-S and E-W
   streets. Rotation to N-S orientation is a valid strategy to mitigate the
   heat stress in summer, with reductions of up to 2 h at the center of the
   street. Aspect ratios between 1 and 1.5 offer a quite acceptable thermal
   performance for summer and winter. PET patterns discussed give
   information about the most suitable locations for pedestrian within the
   street. The urban guidelines presented enable to urban planners
   rehabilitate and design cities, which are able to reduce the impact of
   thermal stress in hot-humid climates. The results could be included in
   the Urban Regulations of Camaguey. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   within protected areas but also tourism and visitation patterns. The
   U.S. National Park Service systematically collects data regarding its
   270+ million annual recreation visits, and therefore provides an
   opportunity to examine how human visitation may respond to climate
   change from the tropics to the polar regions. To assess the relationship
   between climate and park visitation, we evaluated historical monthly
   mean air temperature and visitation data (1979-2013) at 340 parks and
   projected potential future visitation (2041-2060) based on two
   warming-climate scenarios and two visitation-growth scenarios. For the
   entire park system a third-order polynomial temperature model explained
   69% of the variation in historical visitation trends. Visitation
   generally increased with increasing average monthly temperature, but
   decreased strongly with temperatures &gt; 25 degrees C. Linear to
   polynomial monthly temperature models also explained historical
   visitation at individual parks (R-2 0.12-0.99, mean = 0.79, median =
   0.87). Future visitation at almost all parks (95%) may change based on
   historical temperature, historical visitation, and future temperature
   projections. Warming-mediated increases in potential visitation are
   projected for most months in most parks (67-77% of months; range across
   future scenarios), resulting in future increases in total annual visits
   across the park system (8-23%) and expansion of the visitation season at
   individual parks (13-31 days). Although very warm months at some parks
   may see decreases in future visitation, this potential change represents
   a relatively small proportion of visitation across the national park
   system. A changing climate is likely to have cascading and complex
   effects on protected area visitation, management, and local economies.
   Results suggest that protected areas and neighboring communities that
   develop adaptation strategies for these changes may be able to both
   capitalize on opportunities and minimize detriment related to changing
   visitation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Australia has had a variable and mostly arid climate as long as humans
   have been on the continent. Historically observed trends toward
   increased warming, with rainfall increases in many tropical areas and
   rainfall decreases in many temperate areas, are projected to continue.
   Impacts will be geographically variable but mostly negative for
   biodiversity, agriculture, and infrastructure. Extreme events such as
   bushfires and floods will increase in frequency and intensity,
   concentrated in summer. With an economy heavily dependent on coal for
   domestic electricity generation and as an export commodity, Australians
   are high per capita contributors to anthropogenic climate change. A
   quarter-century of steps to mitigation led in 2012 to a carbon price
   that has the long-term potential to shift the economy toward more
   renewable energy sources. However as in other parts of the world this
   change has come too late, and is proceeding too slowly, to avoid
   significant climate change. A heritage of indigenous adaptation, strong
   volunteer cultures, and contemporary cultural diversity provide
   Australia with considerable adaptive capacity for gradual changes, but
   the nation is underprepared for sudden or step changes. We identify four
   pressing research and policy needs focused on such changes: (1)
   systematic attention to processes and impacts of negative transformative
   change, or worst-case scenarios, (2) improve forecasts of year-to-year
   rainfall and climate variability, focusing on processes and climate
   drivers that may change in response to higher greenhouse gases, (3)
   identification and engagement of diverse cross-cultural resources, and
   (4) articulation of alternative governance mechanisms that can interact
   dynamically with strong government. WIREs Clim Change 2014, 5:175-197.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Extreme climatic events will dictate the response of ecosystems to
   climate change, yet are understudied in marine ecosystems. The
   interaction of stressors from such events has the potential to amplify
   negative impacts and drive ecosystems into alternate states. Here, we
   show a drastic response of a temperate seagrass species (Amphibolis
   antarctica) in Shark Bay - a World Heritage Site in Western Australia at
   a temperate-tropical transition zone - to two stressors driven by
   concurrent extreme climatic events: a marine heatwave (Ningaloo Nina)
   and the Gascoyne floods that impacted the west coast of Australia in the
   austral summer of 2010-2011. Widespread defoliation (leaf loss) of
   A.antarctica was observed in the months following the extreme events and
   was highest at sites affected by flooding (Wooramel River floods). We
   propose that the negative impact was magnified by the synergistic
   interactions both stressors had on the carbon balance of the plant. The
   elevated temperatures increased plant demand for carbon, which could not
   be met through photosynthesis due to turbid floodwaters reducing light
   availability, resulting in the plant having a negative carbon balance.
   Two years following the extreme events, recovery of leaf biomass was
   evident, though still 7-20% of historical averages. In contrast,
   below-ground biomass decreased by an order of magnitude in the two years
   following the events. As below-ground reserves underpin the tolerance of
   large seagrass species like A.antarctica to disturbances, the declining
   trajectory of below-ground biomass will likely manifest as a loss of
   resilience in A. antarctica to future disturbances.Synthesis. Given the
   ecological importance of Amphibolis antarctica in Shark Bay as a
   foundation species - accounting for 85% (3700km(2)) of the cover of
   seagrasses in Shark Bay - predicted increases in the frequency and
   magnitude of similar climatic events could have catastrophic
   implications for the future of this World Heritage embayment. Where
   extreme climatic events overlap and cause multiple, synergistic
   stressors to plant communities, ecological responses are likely to be
   more extreme, particularly in ecosystems where foundation species exist
   near upper thermal tolerance limits.</td>

   addressed for the first time, in terms of modelling and predicting
   thermal stress on stone in Europe over the next century. While the
   effect of changing climate on frost in porous materials and on surface
   recession of carbonate stone. has recently been treated, prediction of
   the future evolution of thermal stress on stones still requires
   elucidation. The present paper provides maps showing future scenarios of
   thermal stress on Carrara marble for the 21 st century, using the output
   data from the Hadley general and regional climate models in the European
   window.The work carried out made it possible to forecast in the near and
   far futures (i.e. 2010-2039, 2070-2099) the number of events per year of
   thermal stress in marble greater than 20 MPa, the latter being adopted
   as the maximum sustainable load for this specific material. The data
   demonstrate that the Mediterranean area will continue to experience the
   highest level of risk from thermal stress, with more than 300
   events/year predicted in the 2070-2099 period. In addition, Central
   Europe will be more affected by thermal stress during the present
   century compared to the baseline period, 1961-1990, taken as reference.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The widespread disconnect between scientific projections of climate
   change and the implementation of responsive management actions has
   escalated calls for knowledge production processes able to exercise a
   stronger voice in decision making. Recently, the concept of coproduction
   has been championed as a potential answer. The term 'knowledge
   coproduction' is used loosely in the literature to describe an
   inclusive, iterative approach to creating new information; it is
   distinguished by its focus on facilitating interactions between
   stakeholders to develop an integrated or transformational understanding
   of a sustainability problem. Whether a coproduction process is
   successful in this integration of science and policy depends on a range
   of capabilities that should be understood as 'coproductive capacities.'
   We draw on the literature from sustainability science to propose a
   conceptual framework that specifies the sequential goals of knowledge
   coproduction and potential sources of coproductive capacity. We apply
   this framework to examine our experience facilitating the coproduction
   of a climate change action plan for Papahanaumokuakea Marine National
   Monument and World Heritage Site. This framework offers a structure for
   systematically investigating the capacities, mechanisms, and dynamics of
   knowledge coproduction and for guiding the design of coproduction
   processes.</td>

   environmental conditions once the causes of their formation are
   understood. The objective of this research was to compare tree age,
   canopy class, temperature, precipitation, and growth rate as potential
   causal factors in false ring formation in Pinus banksiana Lambert. Our
   data consisted of 180 R banksiana tree cores from three stands in
   northern lower Michigan. All cores were cross-dated and measured and
   false rings were identified by anatomical features within the wood.
   Frequency of false rings varied, with 48%, 78%, and 80% of the cores
   having at least one false ring in the three stands. Although there was
   within-stand synchrony in the timing of false ring formation no
   significant correlations existed between temperature and precipitation
   records and frequency of false ring production. Event years (periods of
   high false ring formation) were identified and superposed epoch analysis
   detected significantly higher growth rates preceded periods of false
   ring formation at one of the study sites. Canopy class had a significant
   influence on a tree's likelihood of producing false rings: suppressed
   trees were not likely to produce false rings while codominant and
   intermediate trees were more likely to produce false rings. Tree age
   also influences propensity of false ring production with rings formed
   during the early years of a tree's life being more likely to contain
   false rings than rings formed later in life. Based on the results of
   this study, we recommend that dendroecologists include false ring
   analysis in their historical stand reconstructions to improve their
   ability to distinguish between releases in growth triggered by canopy
   gaps (associated with formation of false rings) versus releases in
   growth triggered by climate (no association with false rings). (c) 2006

   have direct impacts on built heritage, it will also have important
   indirect effects through its influence on microbial, plant and animal
   life on heritage sites. Environmental change will affect both the
   structure of biotic communities and the function of such communities.
   Both impacts will, in turn, influence the deterioration and conservation
   of heritage sites. Changes in precipitation will exert a major, but as
   yet poorly understood, control on heritage biotas, whilst changes in
   atmospheric composition may also be important. Climatic changes will
   cause range shifts for some taxa, further influencing community
   composition. Whilst there are many unknowns, making prediction
   difficult, some scenarios can be proposed based on ecological response
   to stress and disturbance. This approach indicates some hotspots at risk
   of experiencing dramatic shifts in biotic communities and their impacts,
   which may switch from biodeteriogenic to bioprotective or vice versa.
   Such hotspots include vulnerable sandstone and limestone heritage
   structures in areas of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Caribbean and
   Southern Africa.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>We elucidate spatial controls of wind and fire disturbance across
   northern Wisconsin (USA), where climatic and topographic gradients are
   not strong, using data from the original US Public Land Survey (PLS)
   notes. These records contain information on the location and extent of
   heavy windthrows and stand-replacing fires prior to Euro-American
   settlement. The spatial patterns of windthrow and fire were spatially
   clustered at all scales in this historical environment, with stronger
   associations at local than regional scales. Logistic regression shows
   environmental variables to have a strong influence on this pattern. In
   the case of heavy windthrow, environmental drivers of disturbance
   pattern are fairly consistent across the region. The effects of climate
   and vegetation are predominant at all scales, but effects are often
   indirect, with strong interactions between them. Interactions between
   these two drivers and soil characteristics are also sometimes present.
   In contrast, models of stand-replacing fire show simple and direct
   control within and across fire-prone landscapes of historical northern
   Wisconsin, with climate and physiography as the main factors explaining
   the distribution of fire disturbance. This simple and direct control is
   lost at the regional scale, where climate, physiographic, soil, and
   vegetation variables, along with interactions between them, are
   significant factors. Contrary to other regions, the topographic effects
   are generally not important in predicting either wind or fire
   disturbance. Our work suggests that, in landscapes that lack strong
   environmental patterning, climate maintains its role as a primary driver
   of these natural disturbances, but topography is replaced by
   interactions and feedbacks with other forms of environmental
   heterogeneity.</td>

   cultural preservation worldwide. Risk maps have become the tool to
   predict cultural heritage vulnerabilities because of irreversible
   cultural characteristics that can never be duplicated after being
   destroyed. Because the concepts of risk maps and cultural heritage
   preservation are relatively new in Taiwan, this study attempts to create
   a set of cultural heritage risk maps. Using flood as its primary
   disaster type and New Taipei City in northern Taiwan as its targeted
   area, this study first analyses disaster-prone areas using current
   global preservation approaches. Thematic analysis and field study are
   also used for analysis. Finally, based on cultural heritage
   vulnerability, the study examines present heritage preservation
   strategies and rediscovers the three aspects of "sustainable management,
   disaster management, and climate change and adaptation" in response to
   cultural heritage management. In addition, this study analyses the
   feasibility of using parks as water detention areas to reduce flood
   damage temporarily not only to cultural heritage areas but to human
   lives and property, as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Geographers and Geography has long been acquainted with the idea of
   climate. For much of the last century, climatology was one of the
   canonical sub-fields of physical geography and interactions between
   climate and the human world have proved fruitful sites of geographical
   inquiry. Although much contemporary scholarship and applied science is
   concerned with the idea of climate change, I believe there is important
   work still to be done on enriching the idea of climate. The argument put
   forward in this essay is that climate - as it is imagined and acted upon
   - needs to be understood, first and foremost, culturally. Rather than
   framing climate as an interconnected global physical system or as a
   statistical artefact of weather measurements, climate should be
   understood equally as an idea that takes shape in cultures and can
   therefore be changed by cultures. Climate has a cultural history, which
   is interwoven with its physical history. It is a history which forms the
   substrate out of which today's beliefs, claims and disputes about
   climate change emerge. This essay develops two core arguments. First,
   climate can be understood culturally, as an idea that humans use to
   stabilise relationships between weather and their patterned lives. In
   its various manifestations around the world, the idea of climate enables
   humans to live with their weather through a widening and changing range
   of cultural resources, practices, artefacts and rituals. Second, I argue
   that such a cultural understanding of climate alters the way the
   contemporary idea of climate change should be conceived; not primarily
   as a physical process which must be stopped, but as the latest stage in
   the cultural evolution of the idea of climate.</td>

   timber yields and other properties of trees. However, such models rely
   on measured relationships between tree growth and historic environmental
   conditions. As anthropogenic actions alter the environment, especially
   atmospheric composition, empirical models become less reliable and
   process-based models become more useful. Process-based models are
   challenged to simulate growth of structurally and physiologically
   complex organisms using explicit mathematical expressions to capture
   growth response to environmental conditions. In this review we summarize
   the physiological requirements of process-based models and examine the
   capabilities of six published models (CARBON, ECOPHYS, PGSM, TREE-BGC,
   TREGRO, W91) for simulating tree response to changes in environmental
   conditions (elevated temperature, increased CO2 concentration, and
   enhanced concentrations of tropospheric ozone). These analyses indicate
   that current models are reliable integrators of environmental effects on
   individual processes (e.g. photosynthesis), but may be less reliable
   where physiological acclimation occurs or when extrapolated to growth of
   specific tree compartments. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

   combines quantitative and qualitative aspects. This approach was
   developed and applied in the Ayutthaya region in Thailand, which is a
   UNESCO World Heritage Site. First, flood risk was assessed traditionally
   as a product of hazard and vulnerability. Both qualitative and
   quantitative data were gathered from publicly available sources and
   through interviews, questionnaires, and focus group discussions to
   assess the vulnerability, using various weights for the different
   vulnerability dimensions. The hazard was assessed using a coupled 1D-2D
   flood model, and the resulting vulnerability and risk were mapped.
   Second, an alternative flood risk map was produced based on group
   mapping exercises with local residents, which captures the level of
   perceived risk. The traditional flood risk map was adjusted by varying
   the vulnerability weights to better match the perceived risk map. The
   analysis of these two maps revealed that two approaches to flood risk
   assessment can be used effectively in gaining different insights of the
   phenomena, and as such, they both should be used in flood risk
   management planning.</td>

   cultural heritage of Basilicata, Southern Italy. Morphological evolution
   of the landscape is characterized by very intense erosive phenomena such
   as landslides, deep gullies, rills, and piping, which affect the
   perimeter of urban settlements and threaten the conservation of these
   sites. Rainfalls and the lithology of the substratum are the main
   factors to which the landscape evolution is linked, triggering landslide
   and linear erosion phenomena. Climate analysis carried out during the
   last century showed an increasing trend in the rainfall intensity over
   extremely short periods. This condition also induced an increase in the
   vulnerability level of the slopes. Integrated analysis between
   territorial data (geology, geomorphology, climate) and historical
   documents showed that, at least from the last century, the
   geomorphological hazard has been accentuated by the intense human
   activity of cave excavation along several fronts under the present urban
   area. The geophysical investigation also permitted the mapping of
   shallow caves and tunnels in the subsurface reconstructing the
   multilevel complex hypogeal system. This work also produced evidence
   that the human interventions occurring during the historical period have
   been a determining factor in increasing the hazard level and
   accelerating the preexisting morphological processes.</td>

   north-eastern coast of Australia. The GBR is worth A$ 15-20 billion/year
   to the Australian economy and provides approximately 64,000 full time
   jobs. Many of the species and ecosystems of the GBR are in poor
   condition and continue to decline. The principal causes of the decline
   are catchment pollutant runoff associated with agricultural and urban
   land uses, climate change impacts and the effects of fishing. Many
   important ecosystems of the GBR region are not included inside the
   boundaries of the World Heritage Area. The current management regime for
   catchment pollutant runoff and climate change is clearly inadequate to
   prevent further decline. We propose a refocus of management on a
   "Greater GBR" (containing not only the major ecosystems and species of
   the GBR, but also its catchment) and on a set of management actions to
   halt the decline of the GBR. Proposed actions include: (1) Strengthen
   management in the areas of the Greater GBR where ecosystems are in good
   condition, with Torres Strait, northern Cape York and Hervey Bay being
   the systems with highest current integrity; (2) Investigate methods of
   cross-boundary management to achieve simultaneous cost-effective
   terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystem protection in the Greater
   GBR; (3) Develop a detailed, comprehensive, costed water quality
   management plan for the Greater GBR; (4) Use the Great Barrier Reef
   Marine Park Act and the Environment Protection and Biodiversity
   Conservation Act to regulate catchment activities that lead to damage to
   the Greater GBR, in conjunction with the relevant Queensland
   legislation; (5) Fund catchment and coastal management to the required
   level to solve pollution issues for the Greater GBR by 2025, before
   climate change impacts on Greater GBR ecosystems become overwhelming;
   (6) Continue enforcement of the zoning plan; (7) Australia to show
   commitment to protecting the Greater GBR through greenhouse gas
   emissions control, at a scale relevant to protecting the GBR, by 2025.

   landscapes that have been shaped by humans for centuries through
   traditional management. Biological and historical data sources were
   employed, and a multi-scale approach was adopted to capture the
   influence of factors affecting the structure of these forests. Landscape
   and stand scale dynamics were analyzed in four watersheds (c. 13,000 ha)
   of the western and central Italian Alps that have experienced different
   land-use intensities. Observed landscape changes were generalized using
   path analyses developed from a common conceptual model. Stand structure
   and a range of environmental variables were sampled in 203 circular
   plots, and land use and anthropogenic variables were derived from
   thematic maps and aerial photographs. We used multivariate statistical
   analyses (ordination and SEM models) to relate forest structure,
   anthropogenic influences, land uses, and topography. The most commonly
   observed land cover transition was an expansion of forests at the
   expense of open areas. All studied watersheds were dominated by larch
   forests, but their structure and spatial pattern differed greatly.
   Anthropogenic variables were less important at Ventina, the least
   accessible site, but emerged as fundamental to explain stand structure
   in the other study sites. Complexity of topography and proximity to
   roads had influenced past human activities mainly in the most accessible
   sites. Regeneration density was greatest at lower elevations and closer
   to human settlements. Quantification of the role played by forest
   harvesting and cattle grazing in past centuries is critical for
   understanding how global change factors may influence future dynamics of
   mountain forests in the European Alps and similar cultural landscapes
   worldwide.</td>

   it may require significant shifts in consumption and economic
   organization. A key question is how these changes can be achieved, by
   regulation or shifts of consciousness on the parts of individuals. Among
   the means by which a shift of awareness might occur is cultural work -
   including the production and reception of art and literature. But does
   art which represents climate change distance or normalize the problem,
   or can new kinds of art construct new ways in which to see or intervene
   in the conditions and systems which produce global warming? The article
   considers recent exhibitions of art dealing with environmental and
   climate change issues in the UK and USA. Before that, the article
   summarizes aspects of recent relevant work on art by geographers.
   Looking at cases of environmentalist art, the article initially
   differentiates art representing climate change in dramatic images from
   an emerging tendency to practical intervention. It argues that art may
   contribute to a shift in attitudes, but wonders whether
   intervention-as-art is in its way another form of representation, and
   whether art inevitably distances whatever problems it addresses. This is
   an insoluble difficulty: the real is always mediated and distanced in
   culture, yet art may still draw attention to conditions and to the
   inherent contradictions they contain.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Wadden Sea is one of the largest intertidal areas in the world and
   has been designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in recognition of
   its unique natural features. major changes in the morphology and ecology
   of the Wadden Sea over the past millennium resulted from increasing
   anthropogenic influences such as coastal protection, land claim from the
   sea and drainage of wetland for agriculture, exploitation of natural
   resources from hunting and fishing to the extraction of groundwater, gas
   and oil, industrialisation at port locations and tourism at the islands.
   A sustainable future can only be achieved if policy and management are
   backed by solid science. Many of the anticipated changes result from the
   upscaling of pressures on the Wadden Sea system. Economic globalization
   leads to upscaling of fisheries, tourism and industrial activities, and
   thus to changed pressures on space and nature. Climate change will lead
   to changes in hydrographic patterns, species distribution and possibly
   tourism; through sea-level rise it will put pressure on coastal
   protection and the extent of intertidal areas. invasions of exotic
   species will transform the ecosystem. There are three major related
   challenges to management: 1. Nature conservation in a changing system
   requires a focus on preservation of the values and not the state of the
   system; 2. The adaptation of the management structure to the scale
   increase of the pressures, so that local and regional management becomes
   better nested in transregional and transnational governance structures;
   3. Finally, the management approach needs to deal with increasing
   uncertainty in external forcing of the system, as well as with
   nonlinearities in system dynamics when it is pushed outside its normal
   range of operation. Based on these pressures and management challenges,
   we advocate an integrated social-ecological systems approach for the
   scientific study and the science-based management of the Wadden Sea
   Region. The essential characteristics of this approach are strong
   interdisciplinarity and a focus on aspects of scale and cumulative
   processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>AimTo examine how current and historical environmental gradients affect
   patterns of millipede (Diplopoda) endemism and species turnover in a
   global hotspot of floristic diversity, and to identify regions of high
   endemism and taxonomic distinctness for conservation
   management.LocationSouth-western Australia.MethodsMuseum database
   records of millipedes (subclasses Pentazonia and Helminthomorpha),
   supplemented with extensive fieldwork, were used to map species
   richness, species turnover (beta-diversity), weighted endemism, average
   taxonomic distinctness and variation in taxonomic distinctness in
   half-degree grid squares (c. 2500 km2). Generalized linear models were
   used to examine relationships between these parameters with rainfall
   (present day and historical), topography and human disturbance (clearing
   for agriculture and urbanization).ResultsMillipede species richness,
   particularly within the order Spirostreptida, and millipede endemism
   were positively associated with large within-cell differences in
   elevation (mountainous regions). Large variation in taxonomic
   distinctness (unevenness in the taxonomic tree) in higher-rainfall areas
   was mainly due to speciation within the Spirostreptida genus
   Atelomastix. Hotspots of millipede endemism and taxonomic distinctness
   were identified within three categories of importance: primary (Stirling
   Range East, Cape Le Grand, Cape Arid, Walpole, Porongurups), secondary
   (Mount Manypeaks, Bremer Bay, Stirling Range West, Duke of Orleans Bay,
   Ravensthorpe, Albany, Busselton) and tertiary (Nornalup). A species
   turnover boundary was positively associated with rainfall, broadly
   located in the transition zone of 300-600 mm year-1.Main conclusionsThe
   current lack of knowledge on the endemism of invertebrates hampers their
   incorporation into conservation planning. With this knowledge we can
   identify global biodiversity hotspots and, at a smaller scale,
   significant conservation areas within a region. Here we have shown that
   weighted endemism and taxonomic distinctness are useful tools in
   identifying centres of high endemism and speciation for millipedes
   within the south-west Australian hotspot. Moreover, it is unlikely that
   either vertebrates or vascular plants will be useful surrogates for
   identifying significant areas for invertebrate conservation. While other
   workers have shown that vascular plants, mammals and frogs have
   different centres of endemism within south-west Australia, our results
   show that centres of endemism for millipedes encompass all of these plus
   other areas.</td>

   detrimental effects of air pollutants. Within the 6th Framework
   Programme of the EU, the CULT-STRAT project is an inter-agency,
   multi-disciplinary project that has integrated research and monitoring
   information to provide answers to policy and management questions, which
   relate the effects of air pollutants on heritage and the management
   options available to mitigate them. The overall aim of the project has
   been to assess and predict the effects of different pollutants on
   materials and objects of cultural heritage in a multipollutant scenario
   and to identify indicators and thresholds levels of pollutants. These
   have been used for development of management strategies for sustainable
   maintenance and preventive conservation of European Cultural Heritage
   and air quality policy from continental to local scale.The present paper
   reports one of the studies carried out in the CULT-STRAT project at city
   level and focused on the town of Madrid (Spain). Different maps are
   shown for the present and possible future scenarios (2010 and 2020):
   inventory of stock of cultural heritage for each selected material,
   concentration of selected pollutants (SO2, NO2, O-3 and PM10), corrosion
   (cast bronze) and recession (Portland limestone), exceedance of
   tolerable degradation thresholds for each material and

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This review demonstrates advances in XRF instrumentation, techniques and
   data processing algorithms published during the last year. Pixellated
   detectors and EDXRF imaging/mapping using a variety of materials and
   readout technologies have set a trend that will undoubtedly continue due
   to improved sensor array fabrication and readout devices that are now
   more widely available. Instrumental development took place at
   synchrotron beamlines with reports that described the measurement and
   data processing methodologies for use with combinations of mu-analytical
   techniques (mu-SRXRF, mu-XANES and mu-PIXE) that offer chemical imaging
   to researchers interested in spatial distribution and speciation of
   elements within plants and cell tissue for environmental studies and
   medical diagnostics. Archaeological and cultural heritage applications
   similarly benefit with insight of the original fabrication or subsequent
   alteration of artefacts. Although recent developments in hand-held
   instrumentation have substantially improved the capabilities of this
   form of XRF, advances in instrumentation continue to be reported. TXRF
   is a growing analytical technique with systematic studies in sample
   preparation, sample shape and influence of absorption on both the
   incident and fluorescent radiation bringing benefits for the analysis of
   environmental samples. A new method of elemental depth profiling has
   been developed and the corrosion process has been characterised with an
   unprecedented level of detail. A large proportion of geological studies
   focused on evidence for climate and environmental change over geological
   time periods.</td>

   regions. Diatom assemblages preserved in lake sediment records can,
   however, provide proxy data of past environmental and biological
   conditions. Sediment cores were retrieved from 209 high altitude lakes
   from 11 countries in Europe. Diatoms were extracted and counted from
   surface-sediment samples and sediments representing pre-industrial
   conditions. Regional changes in diatom assemblages covering at least the
   last c. 150 years are discussed and quantified using ordination
   techniques and dissimilarity indices. Distinct changes in diatom
   composition are identified and regional patterns highlighted, with two
   lake regions showing particularly large changes in diatom composition
   (Central Swiss Alps and the Pyrenees). Several driving mechanisms that
   might have caused the changes in the diatom community are discussed.
   Pre-industrial and present-day lake-water pH are inferred from the
   diatom assemblages and their prediction accuracy compared to
   contemporary water-chemistry measurements for each lake. Regional pH
   changes are minimal with no lake region exceeding 0.27 pH units of
   change in the period covering the last c. 150 years. The majority of
   lakes studied show an increase in planktonic diatom species over the
   period covering the past c. 150 years. We hypothesise that changes in
   the ratio of planktonic to non-planktonic diatoms within the study
   lake-regions are related to changes in climate and to associated changes
   in nutrients, ice-cover and erosion caused by climate warming.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The state of Goa in West India has a 105 km long coastline with beaches
   and cultural heritage sites of significant importance to tourism. The
   increasing incidence of tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea in recent
   decades and the devastating impacts of the December 2004 tsunami in
   India stressed the importance of assessing the vulnerability of coastal
   areas to flooding and inundation, notably in view of climate change
   induced sea-level rising (SLR). This study aims to develop a Coastal
   Vulnerability Index (CVI) for the state of Goa and to use this index to
   examine the vulnerability of the different administrative units of the
   state, known as talukas. This is accomplished by using seven physical
   and geologic risk variables characterising the vulnerability of the
   coast, including historical shoreline change, rate of relative sea-level
   change, coastal regional elevation, coastal slope, mean tidal range,
   significant wave height, and geomorphology using conventional and
   remotely sensed data, in addition to two socioeconomic parameters:
   population and tourist density data. Using a composite CVI based on
   those relative risk variables, each of the seven coastal talukas was
   categorised according to its vulnerability. The resulting vulnerability
   map depicts the talukas that are the most and least vulnerable to
   erosion, flooding and inundation of coastal lands, and that the
   inclusion of socio-economic parameters influences the overall assessment
   of vulnerability. This study provides information aimed at increasing
   awareness amongst decision-makers to deal with disaster mitigation and
   coastal zone management, and is a first step towards prioritising areas
   for climate change adaptation in view of the projected SLR and increased
   storminess. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The United States is an ocean nation-our past, present, and future are
   inextricably connected to and dependent on oceans and marine resources.
   Marine ecosystems provide many important services, including jobs, food,
   transportation routes, recreational opportunities, health benefits,
   climate regulation, and cultural heritage that affect people,
   communities, and economies across the United States and internationally
   every day. There is a wealth of information documenting the strong
   linkages between the planet's climate and ocean systems, as well as how
   changes in the climate system can produce changes in the physical,
   chemical, and biological characteristics of ocean ecosystems on a
   variety of spatial and temporal scales. There is relatively little
   information on how these climate-driven changes in ocean ecosystems may
   have an impact on ocean services and uses, although it is predicted that
   ocean-dependent users, communities, and economies will likely become
   increasingly vulnerable in a changing climate. Based on our current
   understanding and future projections of the planet's ocean systems, it
   is likely that Marine ecosystems will continue to be affected by
   anthropogenic-driven climate change into the future. This review
   describes how these impacts are set in motion through a suite of changes
   in ocean physical, chemical, and biological components and processes in
   US waters and the significant implications of these changes for ocean
   users and the communities and economies that depend on healthy oceans.
   US international partnerships, management challenges, opportunities, and
   knowledge gaps are also discussed. Effectively preparing for and
   responding to climate-driven changes in the ocean will require both
   limiting future change through reductions of greenhouse gases and
   adapting to the changes that we can no longer avoid.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Holocene Megathermal is divided into early, middle and late periods,
   each having different impacts on the Neolithic cultures due to their
   different climate changing trends. This study is based on a comparative
   analysis of the environmental evolution information recorded in the
   Qinghai Lake, the western edge of the Loess Plateau and Zoige and the
   spatial distribution of Neolithic sites of the Gansu-Qinghai region.
   Results show that the early and middle periods towards warm and humid
   promoted the development of Neolithic cultures with agriculture as the
   main sector in the Gansu-Qinghai region, furthermore a heyday of
   Yang-shao Culture prosperity emerged. The Holocene entered the late
   period after the cold climate event at 5.9 ka BP in the Gansu-Qinghai
   region. Later the climate began to turn cold. However, at the 5.8-4.2 ka
   BP a relatively stable warm and humid climate created the conditions for
   the development of Majiayao Culture of the Neolithic Age in this region,
   thus the distribution of its cultural heritage sites expanded towards
   high altitudes and high latitudes. From 4.2 ka BP onwards, the climate
   became cold and dry, which had a significant influence on the Neolithic
   cultures of the Gansu-Qinghai region, leading to a dramatic change in
   the cultural characters and spatial distribution of Qijia Culture around
   4.2 ka BP. After a nearly 300 years of cold and dry period, the unified
   Neolithic farming culture completely collapsed. Afterwards an industrial
   division of animal husbandry and farming and regional multiple cultures
   formed, and ultimately led to the end of primitive society and the
   starting of a civilized society.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A sediment core from Lake Butrint in southwestern Albania contains an
   annually-layered sequence covering the last similar to 300 years. It
   provides thus an exceptionally well-dated time series to study past
   climate-driven environmental changes, as well as anthropogenic
   perturbations along the coast of the Ionian Sea. The varves are composed
   of organic-rich carbonate couplets and detritus-dominated clay layers.
   The first are deposited during spring-to-fall, and reflect the chemistry
   of the lake, which, in turn, is sensitive to 1) the relative importance
   of marine versus freshwater inputs, 2) relative evaporation rates, and
   3) the productivity cycle within the lake. The detrital laminae are
   deposited during winter, reflecting precipitation and runoff conditions
   during the wet season. A 2-3 parts per thousand stable carbon isotope
   ratio shift in both bulk organics and authigenic carbonates was
   attributed to increasing eutrophication towards the end of the 20th
   century, and validated by historical and instrumental data. An increase
   in the delta O-18 of authigenic carbonates by more than 8 parts per
   thousand indicates the progressive salinization of the lake, which can
   primarily be attributed to man-made perturbations that reduced the
   freshwater input to the lake and/or enhanced the exchange with seawater
   from the nearby Ionian Sea. A recent increase in the relative
   evaporation versus precipitation rates may have additionally contributed
   to the observed O-18 enrichment in the Lake Butrint carbonates. The
   interdecadal cyclicity in the thickness of the detrital laminae seems to
   be at least partially controlled by NAO and/or ENSO-like phenomena that
   modulate precipitation patterns in the eastern Mediterranean. Thus, this
   study demonstrates the potential of combining microstratigraphic and
   stable isotopic tools to disentangle anthropogenic and natural
   environmental changes in Lake Butrint, validated by historical records.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the last 5years, climate change has emerged as a dominant theme in
   literature and, correspondingly, in literary studies. Its popularity in
   fiction has given rise to the term cli-fi, or climate change fiction,
   and speculation that this constitutes a distinctive literary genre. In
   theater, the appearance of several big-name productions from 2009 to
   2011 has inspired an increase in climate change plays. There has been a
   growing trend, too, of climate change poetry, thanks to the rise of
   ecopoetry (poetry that exhibits ecological awareness and engages with
   the world's current state of environmental degradation) and the launch
   of some key climate change poetry initiatives in the media. This
   prevalence of climate change literature has brought about a greater
   engagement with climate change in literary studies, notably the
   environmentally oriented branch of literary studies called ecocriticism.
   The increasing number of ecocritical analyses of climate change
   literature, particularly novels, is helping to shape a canon of climate
   change fiction. In a separate development, there has been greater
   interest in the phenomenon of climate change in literary or critical
   theory (the branch of literary studies concerned with literary concepts
   and philosophies rather than with literary texts). This
   developmentcentered on the study of climate change as a philosophical or
   existentialist problemis sometimes termed climate change criticism or
   critical climate change. WIREs Clim Change 2016, 7:266-282. doi:

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Identifying the genetic structure of a species and the factors that
   drive it is an important first step in modern population management, in
   part because populations evolving from separate ancestral sources may
   possess potentially different characteristics. This is especially true
   for climate-sensitive species such as pikas, where the delimitation of
   distinct genetic units and the characterization of population responses
   to contemporary and historical environmental pressures are of particular
   interest. We combined a restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
   (RADSeq) data set containing 4156 single nucleotide polymorphisms with
   ecological niche models (ENMs) of present and past habitat suitability
   to characterize population composition and evaluate the effects of
   historical range shifts, contemporary climates and landscape factors on
   gene flow in Collared Pikas, which are found in Alaska and adjacent
   regions of northwestern Canada and are the lesser-studied of North
   America's two pika species. The results suggest that contemporary
   environmental factors contribute little to current population
   connectivity. Instead, genetic diversity is strongly shaped by the
   presence of three ancestral lineages isolated during the Pleistocene
   (similar to 148 and 52kya). Based on ENMs and genetic data, populations
   originating from a northern refugium experienced longer-term stability,
   whereas both southern lineages underwent population expansion -
   contradicting the southern stability and northern expansion patterns
   seen in many other taxa. Current populations are comparable with respect
   to generally low diversity within populations and little-to-no recent
   admixture. The predominance of divergent histories structuring
   populations implies that if we are to understand and manage pika
   populations, we must specifically assess and accurately account for the
   forces underlying genetic similarity.</td>

   major impacts expected to result from climate change in coastal
   ecosystems. Coastal national parks have many low-lying areas that are at
   risk from inundation resulting from these impacts. To help park managers
   meet their goal of preserving resources, we developed a methodology to
   evaluate risk of inundation from sea level rise and storm surge at
   sentinel sites, areas of importance for natural, cultural, and
   infrastructural resources. We selected the most recent, readily
   available, and appropriate geospatial tools, models, and data sets to
   conduct case studies of our coastal inundation risk assessments in two
   northeastern coastal national parks-Cape Cod National Seashore, MA, and
   Assateague Island National Seashore, MD/VA. We collected elevation data
   at sentinel sites using real-time kinematic global positioning system
   (RTK GPS) technology. We used three modeling approaches: modified
   bathtub modeling; the Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM); and the
   Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH) model to assess
   the likelihood of inundation at sentinel sites. Cape Cod's sentinel
   sites, which in many cases occurred in high-elevation settings, were
   found to be less vulnerable to inundation than were Assateague Island's
   sentinel sites, which were distributed in low-lying areas along the
   barrier beach island. This inundation risk assessment methodology can be
   applied to other coastal areas and to the same coastal parks at
   different times as more accurate elevation data sets and updated sea
   level rise projections become available.</td>

   large river basins (more than 100 000 km(2)). Recent estimates indicate
   that more than 700 000 km(2) of Brazilian Amazon have already been
   deforested, and to reduce further losses and preserve the important
   natural and cultural resources in this region, large conservation areas
   have been created by the Brazilian government. The present study
   analysed land cover and land use change in the major watersheds of the
   Brazilian Amazon, in order to evaluate the current balance between
   deforestation and conservation of natural areas in the region. The
   results show that watersheds draining the southern part of the basin
   have suffered the highest deforestation rates, with the largest losses
   (8.3-20% of total basin area) occurring in the Madeira, Tapajos, Xingu,
   Araguaia and Tocantins river basins. Most large watersheds already have
   significant deforestation in their headwaters, which can affect
   hydrological functions and ecological sustainability. The greatest
   allocation of land for conservation was encountered in the Trombetas,
   Xingu and Negro watersheds, where conservation areas occupied 92.5, 56.9
   and 50.6% of the total basin, respectively. While extensive areas of the
   Amazon biome have been deforested, on the scale of large watersheds
   there is a positive balance between conservation areas and
   deforestation, and on average the area delimited by conservation areas
   is more than three times larger than the deforested areas. An analysis
   by subwatersheds, however, indicates that certain regions have achieved
   more critical levels of deforestation, in some situations affecting more
   than 80% of the subwatersheds.</td>

   Results from 124 reviewed publications show that scholarly interest in

   represents diverse natural and social science disciplines. Despite such
   increasing and diverse interest in climate change and cultural heritage
   and resources, the geographic scope of research is limited

   for future studies that not only focuses on efficient, sustainable
   adaptation planning options but also documents if, and how, the
   implementation of cultural heritage and resources adaptation or
   preservation is taking place. This systematic literature review can help
   direct scholarly research in climate change and cultural heritage and

   integrated EU project "Climate for Culture". The full name, or title, of
   the project is Climate for Culture: damage risk assessment, economic
   impact and mitigation strategies for sustainable preservation of
   cultural heritage in times of climate change. This paper focusses on
   implementing high resolution regional climate models together with new
   building simulation tools in order to predict future outdoor and indoor
   climate conditions. The potential impact of gradual climate change on
   historic buildings and on the vast collections they contain has been
   assessed. Two moderate IPCC emission scenarios A1B and RCP 4.5 were used
   to predict indoor climates in historic buildings from the recent past
   until the year 2100. Risks to the building and to the interiors with
   valuable artifacts were assessed using damage functions. A set of
   generic building types based on data from existing buildings were used
   to transfer outdoor climate conditions to indoor conditions using high
   resolution climate projections for Europe and the
   Mediterranean.ResultsThe high resolution climate change simulations have
   been performed with the regional climate model REMO over the whole of
   Europe including the Mediterranean region. Whole building simulation
   tools and a simplified building model were developed for historic
   buildings; they were forced with high resolution climate simulations.
   This has allowed maps of future climate-induced risks for historic
   buildings and their interiors to be produced. With this procedure future
   energy demands for building control can also be
   calculated.ConclusionWith the newly developed method described here not
   only can outdoor risks for cultural heritage assets resulting from
   climate change be assessed, but also risks for indoor collections. This
   can be done for individual buildings as well as on a larger scale in the
   form of European risk maps. By using different standardized and
   exemplary artificial buildings in modelling climate change impact, a
   comparison between different regions in Europe has become possible for
   the first time. The methodology will serve heritage owners and managers
   as a decision tool, helping them to plan more effectively mitigation and
   adaption measures at various levels.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper provides constraints on the evolution of the landscape in the
   Cradle of Humankind (CoH), UNESCO World Heritage Site, South Africa,
   since the Pliocene. The aim is to better understand the distribution of
   hominin fossils in the CoH, and determine links between tectonic
   processes controlling the landscape and the evolution and distribution
   of hominins occupying that landscape. The paper is focused on a detailed
   reconstruction of the landscape through time in the Grootvleispruit
   catchment, which contains the highly significant fossil site of Malapa
   and the remains of the hominin species Australopithicus sediba.In the
   past 4 My the landscape in the CoH has undergone major changes in its
   physical appearance as a result of river incision, which degraded older
   African planation surfaces, and accommodated denudation of cover rocks
   (including Karoo sediments and various sil- and ferricretes) to expose
   dolomite with caves in which fossils collected. Differentially weathered
   chest breccia dykes, calibrated with Be-10 exposure ages, are used to
   estimate erosion patterns of the landscape across the CoH. In this
   manner it is shown that 2 My ago Malapa cave was similar to 50 m deep,
   and Gladysvale cave was first exposed; i.e. landscape reconstructions
   can provide estimates for the time of opening of cave systems that
   trapped hominin and other fossils.Within the region, cave formation was
   influenced by lithological, layer-parallel controls interacting with
   cross-cutting fracture systems of Paleoproterozoic origin, and a NW-SE
   directed extensional far-field stress at a time when the African erosion
   surface was still intact, and elevations were probably lower. Cave
   geometries vary in a systematic manner across the landscape, with deep
   caves on the plateau and cave erosion remnants in valleys. Most caves
   formed to similar depths of 1400-1420 mamsl across much of the CoH,
   indicating that caves no longer deepened once Pliocene uplift and
   incision occurred, but acted as passive sediment traps on the
   landscape.Caves in the CoH are distributed along lithological boundaries
   and NNE and ESE fractures. Fossil-bearing caves have a distinct
   distribution pattern, with different directional controls, a high degree
   of clustering, a characteristic spacing of 1700 m or 3400 m, and a
   characteristic bi-model fractal distribution best explained by a
   combination of geological and biological controls. It is suggested that
   clustering of fossil-bearing caves reflects a Levy flight patterns
   typical for foraging behavior in animals. The controlling element in
   this behavior could have been availability of water in or near groups of
   caves, resulting in preferential occupation of these caves with
   accumulation of diverse faunal fossil assemblages.The tectonic drivers
   shaping the dynamic landscape of the CoH did not involve large,
   seismically active fault lines, but complex interactions between
   multiple smaller fractures and joints activated in a far field stress
   controlled by uplift. The landscape of the CoH, with its caves and water
   sources and dissected landscape provided a setting favored by many
   animals including hominins. A modern day analog for what the CoH would
   have looked like 2 My ago is found 50 km east of Johannesburg, near the
   SE margin of the Johannesburg Dome. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   However, its potential to affect our cultural heritage has not been
   discussed in detail (i.e. not explicit in IPCC 4) even though the
   cultural impacts of future outdoor climate have been the focus of some
   European Commission projects (e.g. NOAH'S ARK) and World Heritage Centre
   reports. Recently there have been a few projects that have examined the
   changing environmental threats to tangible heritage indoors (e.g.
   Preparing Historic Collections for Climate Change and Climate for
   Culture). Here we predict future indoor temperature and humidity, and
   damage arising from changes to climate in historic rooms in Southern
   England with little climate control, using simple building simulations
   coupled with high resolution (similar to 5 km) climate predictions. The
   calculations suggest an increase in indoor temperature over the next
   century that is slightly less than that outdoors. Annual relative
   humidity shows little change, but the seasonal cycles suggest drier
   summers and slightly damper winters indoors. Damage from mould growth
   and pests is likely to increase in the future, while humidity driven
   dimensional change to materials (e.g. wood) should decrease somewhat.
   The results allow collection managers to prepare for the impact of
   long-term climate change, putting strategic measures in place to prevent
   increased damage, and thus preserve our heritage for future generations.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Sundarbans is a deltaic mangrove forest, formed about 7000 years ago
   by the deposition of sediments from the foothills of the Himalayas
   through the Ganges river system, and is situated southwest of Bangladesh
   and south of West Bengal, India. However, for the last 40 years, the
   discharge of sediment-laden freshwater into the Bay of Bengal through
   the Bangladesh part of the Sundarbans Mangrove Forests ( BSMF) has been
   reduced due to a withdrawal of water during the dry period from the
   Farakka Barrage in India. The result is two extremes of freshwater
   discharge at Gorai, the feeding River of the BSMF: a mean minimum
   monthly discharge varies from 0.00 to 170 m3 . s- 1 during the dry
   period with a mean maximum of about 4000 to 8880 m3 . s- 1 during the
   wet period. In the BSMF, about 180 km downstream, an additional low
   discharge results in the creation of a polyhaline environment ( a
   minimum of 194.4 m3 . s- 1 freshwater discharge is needed to maintain an
   oligohaline condition) during the dry period. The Ganges water carries
   262 million ton sediments/ year and only 7% is diverted in to southern
   distributaries. The low discharge retards sediment deposition in the
   forestlands' base as well as the formation of forestlands. The increase
   in water flow during monsoon on some occasions results in erosion of the
   fragile forestlands. Landsat Satellite data from the 1970s to 2000s
   revealed a non- significant decrease in the forestlands of total
   Sundarbans by 1.1% which for the 6017 km2 BSMF is equivalent to 66 km2.
   In another report from around the same time, the estimated total
   forestland loss was approximately 127 km2. The Sundarbans has had great
   influence on local freshwater environments, facilitating profuse growth
   of Heritiera fomes ( sundri), the tallest ( at over 15 m) and most
   commercially important plant, but now has more polyhaline areas
   threatening the sundri, affecting growth and distribution of other
   mangroves and biota. Landsat images and GIS data from 1989 to 2010 at
   the extreme northern part of Khulna and Chandpai Ranges revealed the
   formation of a large number of small rivers and creeks some time before
   2000 that reduce the 443 km2 forestland by 3.61%, approximately 16 km2,
   and decreasing H. fomes by 28.75% and total tree cover by over 3.0%. The
   number of the relatively low- priced plants Bruguiera sexangula,
   Excoecaria agallocha and Sonneratia apetala, has, on the other hand,
   increased. Similar degradation could be occurring in other ranges,
   thereby putting the survivability of the Bangladesh Sundarbans at risk.
   The growing stock of 296 plants per ha in 1959 had been reduced to 144
   by 1996. Trend analysis using " Table Curve 2D Programme," reveals a
   decreased number of 109 plants by the year 2020. The degradation of the
   Bangladesh Sundarbans has been attributed to reduced sediment- laden
   freshwater discharge through the BSMF river system since commissioning
   the Farakka Barrage on 21 April 1975 in India. To reduce salinity and
   forestland erosion, the maintenance of sediment- laden freshwater
   discharge through its river system has been suggested to re- create its
   pre- 1975 environment for the growth of H. fomes, a true mangrove and
   the highest carbon- storing plant of the Sundarbans. This may possibly
   be achieved by proper sharing of the Ganges water from the Farakka
   Barrage, forming a consortium of India, Nepal, Bhutan and China, and
   converting parts or whole of the Ganges River into water reservoir(
   s).The idea is to implement the Ganges Barrage project about 33 km
   downstream, dredging sediments of the entire Gorai River and
   distributaries in the Ganges floodplain, thus allowing uniform sediment-
   laden freshwater flow to maintain an oligohaline environment for the
   healthy growth of mangroves. The system will also create healthy
   hinterlands of the Ganges floodplain with increased crop production and
   revenue. The expenditure may be met through carbon trading, as
   Bangladesh is a signatory of the Copenhagen Accord, UN Framework
   Convention on Climate Change. The total carbon reserve in the BSMF in
   2010 was measured at about 56 million metric tons, valued at a minimum
   of US$ 280 million per year. The forest is rich in biodiversity, where
   over 65 species of mangroves and about 1136 wildlife species occur. The
   BSMF acts as a natural wall, saving property as well as millions of
   lives from natural disasters, the value of which is between 273 and 714
   million US$. A 15 to 20 km band impact zone exists to the north and east
   of the BSMF, with a human settlement of about 3.5 million that is partly
   dependent on the forests. Three wildlife sanctuaries are to the south of
   the BSMF, the home of the great royal Bengal tigers, covering a total
   area of about 1397 km2. Construction of a coal- fired power plant at
   Rampal will be the largest threat to the Sundarbans. It is a reserve
   forest, declared as a Ramsar site of international importance and a
   UNESCO natural world heritage site.</td>

   and on biodiversity conservation. The effects of shortening rotations on
   provisioning services are expected to be mostly negative to neutral
   (e.g. production of wood, bilberries, reindeer forage), while those of
   extending rotations would be more varied. Shortening rotations may help
   limit damage by some of today's major damaging agents (e.g. root rot,
   cambium-feeding insects), but may also increase other damage types (e.g.
   regeneration pests) and impede climate mitigation. Supporting (water,
   soil nutrients) and cultural (aesthetics, cultural heritage) ecosystem
   services would generally be affected negatively by shortened rotations

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In recent years, the frequency of catastrophes induced by natural
   hazards has increased, and flood events in particular have been
   recognized as one of the most threatening water-related disasters.
   Severe floods have occurred in Europe over the last decade, causing loss
   of life, displacement of people and heavy economic losses. Flood
   disasters are growing in frequency as a consequence of many factors,
   both climatic and non-climatic. Indeed, the current increase of
   water-related disasters can be mainly attributed to the increase of
   exposure (elements potentially at risk in flood-prone area) and
   vulnerability (i.e. economic, social, geographic, cultural and
   physical/environmental characteristics of the exposure). Besides these
   factors, the undeniable effect of climate change is projected to
   strongly modify the usual pattern of the hydrological cycle by
   intensifying the frequency and severity of flood events at the local,
   regional and global scale. Within this context, the need for developing
   effective and pro-active strategies, tools and actions which allow one
   to assess and (possibly) to reduce the flood risks that threatens
   different relevant receptors becomes urgent. Several methodologies to
   assess the risk posed by water-related natural hazards have been
   proposed so far, but very few of them can be adopted to implement the
   last European Flood Directive (FD). This paper is intended to introduce
   and present a state-of-the-art Regional Risk Assessment (RRA)
   methodology to appraise the risk posed by floods from a
   physical-environmental perspective. The methodology, developed within
   the recently completed FP7-KULTURisk Project (Knowledge-based approach
   to develop a cULTUre of Risk prevention - KR) is flexible and can be
   adapted to different case studies (i.e. plain rivers, mountain torrents,
   urban and coastal areas) and spatial scales (i.e. from catchment to the
   urban scale). The FD compliant KR-RRA methodology is based on the
   concept of risk being function of hazard, exposure and vulnerability. It
   integrates the outputs of various hydrodynamic models with site-specific
   bio-geophysical and socio-economic indicators (e.g. slope, land cover,
   population density, economic activities etc.) to develop tailored risk
   indexes and GIS-based maps for each of the selected receptors (i.e.
   people, buildings, infrastructure, agriculture, natural and semi-natural
   systems, cultural heritage) in the considered region. It further
   compares the baseline scenario with alternative scenarios, where
   different structural and/or non-structural mitigation measures are
   planned and eventually implemented. As demonstrated in the companion
   paper (Part 2, Ronco et al., 2014), risk maps, along with related
   statistics, allow one to identify and classify, on a relative scale,
   areas at risk which are more likely to be affected by floods and support
   the development of strategic adaptation and prevention measures to
   minimizing flood impacts. In addition, the outcomes of the RRA can be
   eventually used for a further socio-economic assessment, considering the
   tangible and intangible costs as well as the human dimension of
   vulnerability.</td>

   World Heritage Sites inscribed in that region yet a significant number
   of these sites are under threat from the combined and linked processes
   of poverty, war, environmental change and increasingly globalized
   economic and communication systems. Cultural resource management
   provision across the region's countries suffers from severe
   under-resourcing and a limited skills base. In order to redress this
   imbalance greater emphasis needs to be placed on examining more
   sustainable mechanisms for developing research and management strategies
   for the future protection of Africa's archaeological resource. World
   Heritage inscription has become an all-consuming process, draining
   resources and diverting attention away from broader heritage provisions.
   As an integral part of this process archaeology needs to become embedded
   within the international development framework where it can become an
   advocacy voice for community and for poverty alleviation and contribute
   to the debate on environment and climate change. This can be achieved
   only once the specialized heritage agencies become less exclusive and
   more integrated within international frameworks of development and
   reconstructive work. Existing NGOs have an intrinsic role to play in
   this process and will need to adopt cultural heritage into their sphere

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Wildfires influence many temperate terrestrial ecosystems worldwide.
   Historical environmental heterogeneity created by wildfires has been
   altered by human activities and will be impacted by future climate
   change. Our ability to predict the impact of wildfire-created
   heterogeneity on biodiversity is limited because few studies have
   investigated variation in community composition (beta-diversity) in
   response to fire. Wildfires may influence beta-diversity through several
   ecological mechanisms. First, highseverity fires may decrease
   beta-diversity by homogenizing species composition when they create
   landscapes dominated by disturbance-tolerant or rapidly colonizing
   species. In contrast, mixed-severity fires may increase beta-diversity
   by creating mosaic landscapes containing habitats that support species
   with differing environmental tolerances and dispersal traits. Moreover,
   the effects of fire severity on betadiversity may change depending on
   site conditions. Disturbance is hypothesized to increase local species
   richness at higher productivity and decrease local species richness at
   lower productivity, a process that can have important, but largely
   unexamined, consequences on beta-diversity in fire-prone ecosystems. We
   tested these hypotheses by comparing patterns of beta-diversity and
   species richness across 162 plant communities in three sites that span a
   large-scale gradient in climate and productivity in the Northern Rockies
   of Montana. Within each site, we used spatially explicit fire-severity
   data to stratify sampling across unburned forests and forests burned
   with mixed-and high-severity wildfires. We found that betadiversity
   (community dispersion) of forbs was higher in mixed-severity compared to
   high-severity fire, regardless of productivity. Counter to our
   predictions, local species richness of forbs was higher in burned
   landscapes compared to unburned landscapes at the low-productivity site,
   but lower in burned landscapes at the high-productivity site. This
   pattern may be explained by rapid regeneration of woody plants after
   fire in high-productivity forests. Moreover, forbs and woody plants had
   disproportionately higher overall species richness in mixed-severity
   fire compared to high-severity fire, but only at the low-productivity
   site. These patterns suggest that mixed-severity fires promote higher
   landscape-level biodiversity in lowproductivity sites by increasing
   species turnover across landscapes with a diverse mosaic of habitats.
   Our study illustrates the importance of understanding the mechanisms by
   which patterns of wildfire severity interact with environmental
   gradients to influence patterns of biodiversity across spatial scales.</td>

   largest mangrove forest declared as a World Heritage site by UNESCO in
   2007.Findings - The study extends prior research on biodiversity
   accounting by exploring the applicability of Jones' natural inventory
   model in the context of Bangladesh. The results indicate that
   application of Jones' natural inventory model is feasible in the context
   of developing countries such as Bangladesh. It is also recognised that
   the socio-economic and political environment prevailing in developing
   economies may lead to the emergence of important stakeholder groups
   including local civil society bodies, international donor agencies and
   foreign governments. Biodiversity accounting may provide a legitimate
   basis for the government in allaying concerns regarding environmental
   stewardship and assist in negotiations with powerful stakeholder groups
   on important issues such as financial assistance after natural disasters
   and claims to the global climate change fund.Originality/value - This is
   one of the early attempts to operationalise biodiversity accounting in
   the context of a developing economy.</td>

   improve the energy performance of the residential sector. In this
   context, particular attention should be given to historical buildings,
   which represent a large part of the Italian building stock. To improve
   the energy performance of them, adequate retrofit actions must be
   applied. Many studies and regulations have focused on identifying the
   best refurbishment measures. However, the selection of these measures is
   difficult due to restrictive regulations, which are dictated by the
   Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, high retrofit costs, and
   variable climate zones. Thus, energy renovations in Italian buildings
   are not simple, and it is very difficult to find generic solutions that
   can be applied to buildings across the entire territory.In this paper,
   the authors investigated the most common retrofit solutions used in
   Italy, focusing in particular on the energy performance of historical
   building envelopes. First, energy performance analyses were conducted
   for two typical base cases in four different Italian cities using TRNSYS
   software, and some common retrofit measures were analysed. In some
   cases, the results showed Primary Energy saving of 44.6% (sample A) and
   56.7% (sample B). Furthermore, these were used to identify different
   energy and economic impacts associated with the same refurbishment
   measures in different climatic contexts, highlighting the non-existence
   of a generic solution suitable for all regions or countries. (C) 2016

   and changing weather patterns will not be evenly distributed. In
   addition, continued urban, agricultural, and industrial development
   concentrated in coastal areas contributes to the destruction of cultural
   resources. Mitigation of these threats requires rapid action on the part
   of archaeologists and public land managers. This study presents a method
   for quickly evaluating relative resource vulnerability at national,
   regional, and local scales, using data that is available for all United

   Three regional case studiesthe mountainous coast of California's Santa
   Barbara Channel, the wetlands and sandy shores of Texas, and the
   protected estuarine shores of Virginia's Chesapeake Bayare compared to
   shoreline vulnerability for the United States as a whole. In each of
   these regions, sites have already been submerged under rising tides,
   lost to storm erosion, or destroyed by human activities. Variability in
   coastal geomorphology, rates of relative sea-level rise, and the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper is concerned with the role of cultural heritage in coastal
   areas, including land belts and coastal marine waters in the prospect of
   operating sustainable development-aimed strategies. It is a part of the
   investigations carried out in the framework of the Progetto Finalizzato
   Beni Culturali (Special Project Safeguard of Cultural Heritage) convened
   by the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR, the Italian National
   Research Council). Essentially, it aims at contributing to the
   discussion on how the mise-en-valeur of the coastal cultural heritage
   may be framed within integrated coastal management programmes. In this
   view, the discourse on the coastal cultural heritage runs along this
   pathway: (i) global (climatic) change and globalisation are assumed to
   be the key components of the external environment with which the coastal
   area interacts; (ii) the conceptual framework of coastal management, as
   it can be deduced by the background guidelines from Agenda 21 (United
   Nations Conference on Environment and Development, UNCED), is
   considered; (iii) the legal framework, which the coastal area is
   characterised by, is taken into account by focusing on its implications
   on the management patterns. At this point, attention is concentrated on
   the role of cultural heritage in the framework of integrated coastal
   management approaches. It is considered, how this pivotal component of
   the coastal area has been dealt with bythe intergovernmental
   organisations. Special consideration is attributed to the European Code
   of Conduct for Coastal Management Zones, since it considers the
   ecological patrimony and cultural heritage as giving shape to a unique
   ethically-endowed reality, which materialised through landscapes and
   seascapes. The final step consists of the design of a tentative Code of
   Conduct for Coastal Cultural Heritage consisting of some background and
   operational principles. (C) 2003 Editions scientifiques et medicales

   universal value, providing society with critical ecosystem services like
   biodiversity, clean water, and recreational opportunity. Every natural
   WH site is at risk from climate change, but the scope and nature of that
   risk varies widely. Climate change adaptation is a wicked problem; that
   is, there are no clear-cut solutions and stakeholders at each site
   disagree on values, norms and first steps, making adaptation difficult.
   Yet, delaying action poses more risks than taking action under
   uncertainty. I synthesize the refereed literature relevant to climate
   adaptation for natural WH sites. I argue that adaptation should be
   ecosystem based. It should begin by understanding linkages among site
   attributes and the surrounding landscape, and asking how off-site and
   on-site practices might reduce risk of negative effects of climate
   change on those attributes. Adaptation responses are tiered. Fine-scale,
   on-site responses are less expensive and easier but will have less
   impact than coarse-scale responses involving the surrounding community.
   We cannot precisely predict future conditions so we must act adaptively,
   designing responses, acting, evaluating results, re-designing and trying
   again. Action is constrained by institutional mandates focused on
   preserving existing conditions rather than recognizing a dynamic future.
   Climate change adaptation at natural WH sites should be Adaptive,
   Participatory and Transformative, deployed through clumsy solutions.
   Such solutions will require strong leadership and excellent
   communication, drawing together widely disparate views and iterative
   practices focusing on resilience. That requirement establishes the need
   for capacity development for climate change adaptation. (C) 2014

   cultural heritage sites, an attempt was made to examine the natural and
   anthropogenic causes driving the vegetation dynamics and exploitation of
   a small mountain wetland. To assess its potential use as an archive of
   the landscape history, an environmental archaeology approach was used:
   palaeoenvironmental data from traditional pollen sampling by coring were
   matched with stratigraphic information from an excavation area of
   several square metres, and plant micro- and macroremain analyses (e.g.
   pollen assemblages, micro- and macrocharcoal, morphological and
   dendrochronological features of waterlogged tree trunks) were compared
   in order to evaluate them as effects of different environmental factors
   and to pinpoint these factors. In this paper, the focus is set mainly on
   the results originating from pollen analyses of a core drilled in the
   peat-bog, a few metres from the stratigraphic excavation. The start of
   peat deposition, sometimes coinciding with human activity, was dated
   around 10,000 cal. BP. The impact on the vegetation surrounding the site
   is clearly recorded in the pollen assemblages only from the Roman period
   (2010-1820 cal. BP) even though a long history of human presence is
   archaeologically documented in the area since the Palaeolithic. Since
   that time, the abrupt decline of fir favoured the final spread of beech
   which, in turn, in the Middle Ages (1180-790 cal. BP) leaves space to
   grassland exploitable for pasture and for agro-silvi-pastoral
   activities. This site has proven to be of great importance for the
   Holocene history of the silver fir.</td>

   causing significant changes to the global climate, which are being felt
   currently and are likely to increase in the future. This is beginning to
   place exceptional strains on the historic environment, here defined as
   both above and below ground archaeological remains. Using examples from
   the cultural list of World Heritage Sites in mainland Britain, this
   paper explores how knowledge of past and contemporary geological and
   geomorphological processes can provide an understanding of natural
   hazards and risk assessment. This, in turn, can inform management
   strategies to allow the protection and stabilisation of sites, limit
   further degradation and ensure long-term sustainability. From the
   analysis of published documentation available from UNESCO, it appears
   that natural processes have not always received the attention they
   deserve, and in some cases appear to have been ignored. Given the
   complexity of future climate change and the role that natural processes
   will play in determining the vulnerability of individual heritage
   assets, it is essential that geoscientists, archaeologists and cultural
   heritage managers work together to develop appropriate strategies to
   mitigate the effects of change in the future, especially since many of
   the themes developed in this paper have generic applicability across a

   shift from predominantly wet, tropical, conditions to a much drier
   climate. Little is known, however, about the effect of this important
   continent-wide event on freshwater organisms and ecosystems. Fairy
   shrimps (Crustacea; Anostraca) are ancient and specialist inhabitants of
   temporary and saline aquatic habitats that typically prevail under
   semiarid conditions. Therefore, they present suitable evolutionary
   models to study scenarios of historic environmental change and the
   impact of a drying climate on aquatic ecosystems in particular.
   Focussing on both macro- and micro-evolution in the fairy shrimp genus
   Branchinella and using mitochondrial DNA data (16S and COI), we
   evaluated whether patterns of contemporary genetic variation reflect
   historic climate change. There is a close match between episodes of
   Cenozoic climate change and macro-evolutionary diversification in
   Australian fairy shrimps, presumably mediated by a progressive increase
   in the abundance and diversity of temporary aquatic habitats on the
   continent. Micro-evolutionary patterns reflect both range expansion and
   recent contraction, linked to extreme drying events during the
   Pleistocene glacial periods. This study effectively illustrates the
   potential long-term effects of environmental change on the diversity and
   the evolutionary trajectories of the fauna of temporary waters.
   Moreover, it demonstrates the importance of adaptation to new
   environments and non-adaptive processes, such as divergence in
   isolation, for explaining extant diversity patterns in this particular
   environment.</td>

   erosion resulting from predicted future sea-level rise and increased
   storminess. As all sites cannot be protected, it is essential that
   heritage managers know which sites and landscapes are most at risk so
   they can prioritize resources and decision-making most effectively. One
   method of doing so is through desk-based modeling of coastal
   vulnerability. This article outlines the advantages and limitations of
   such an approach and demonstrates the application of a desk-based model
   to case studies from Newfoundland's coast. The rate of future sea-level
   rise around Newfoundland is complicated by its glacio-isostatic recovery
   since the last ice age. The first step therefore in this assessment is
   to combine output from glacio-isostatic adjustment models with
   appropriate rates of global eustatic sea-level rise. Next, these data
   are integrated with existing information on coastal characteristics
   (topography, surficial geology, erosion rates) to assess coastal
   sensitivity to sea-level rise. Finally, overlay of known archaeological
   sites identifies those locations at greatest risk from destructive
   coastal changes. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of such
   models for regional-scale analyses but caution against the use of low
   resolution data to generate site-specific predictions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The future of southern Italian regions lays mainly on conservation and
   recovery of their peculiar environment (i.e., pleasant climate,
   beautiful nature and historic heritage). Presently, most of such regions
   have to face major problems related to water shortage for agriculture
   and, in some cases, even for drinking purposes. In these regions water
   shortage is a growing problem and wastewater reclamation and reuse, a
   key options for their sustainable development, has not yet been
   implemented at large scale. In these regions, the interest for
   wastewater reuse is particularly addressed to agricultural and landscape
   irrigation with the aim of both enhancing the local economy, mostly
   based on agriculture, and saving good quality water resources for
   drinking purposes. Referring to the Apulia region, it has many analogies
   with other areas affected by chronic water scarcity, i.e: the rapid
   development of local economy, the changes in traditional agriculture
   practices and land use, the groundwater over-exploitation with
   consequent sea water intrusion, the climate changes. The mix of all
   these factors, although with a different weight, has been the main cause
   of the frequent water shortage problems recorded in the region. Although
   over the last decades these problems have been partially mitigated by
   the construction of water transport infrastructures and reservoirs, they
   are still far to be definitely solved. Because of this, finally,
   regional authorities have defined a water resources protection and
   management master plan in which the reuse of treated wastewater, not
   only in agriculture, plays a relevant role [1]. This paper outlines the
   local environmental conditions and the rationale supporting such a
   choice.</td>

   landscapes continuously. As historical and ongoing changes differ in
   character and intensity from time to time and from region to region
   whereas landscapes themselves differ in their responses, temporal and
   regional specification is required. From a policy point of view the
   questions are: i) what are the direction and rate of changes? ii) how to
   value these; iii) whether or not to intervene; and iv) if so, how?
   Options vary from compensation measures and mitigation of effects to
   targeting at direct influences or so-called driving forces (DFs). A
   co-ordinated and proactive and effective policy is mostly preferred to
   of a reactive policy aimed at end-of-pipe measures. To sustain conscious
   choices one should identify underlying causes and processes (i.e. DFs),
   cause-effect tracks and possibilities to intervene. The concept of
   driving forces is explained and elaborated, specifically for landscapes.
   We use two related conceptual models; the first based on the DPSIR
   (Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) concept and - more targeted- a
   'mental map' for landscape change. A third concept helps to distinguish
   decision-making philosophies or stages according to their scope and time
   horizon. Current and foreseeable trends in Europe herald major changes
   affecting biodiversity, cultural heritage, scenery, environmental
   quality and economic values. Important DFs are: i) the (largely
   man-induced) global change in climate and sea level rise; ii) land-use
   change in rural areas, related to a change in demography, technological
   development, geopolitical change, macroeconomic change and sociocultural
   changes; and iii) urbanization processes. All processes affect vast
   areas in Europe. We give examples for climate change and change in
   agriculture in Europe. Policymaking could be more effective when
   targeted on driving forces, though second-best strategies can be
   inevitable.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Long-term studies across Europe have clarified the eco-cultural nature
   of landscapes and their biodiversity, and the importance of bio-cultural
   heritage. This raises issues of the nature of 'Nature' for example, and
   of how perceptions of 'natural' landscapes may be misleading. Indeed,
   the lack of understanding of how ecological systems and their
   biodiversity relate to the cultural nature of landscapes is hugely
   problematic. Whilst wilder 'futurescapes' offer many benefits, the
   underlying concepts frequently confuse abandonment of 'eco-cultural
   landscapes' with 're-wilding'. The ending of traditional and customary
   uses and utilisation of landscapes mistakenly seen as re-naturing or
   re-wilding, and inherently a beneficial change, may threaten the
   conservation of important bio-cultural heritage. The reality of
   landscape heritage is that much biodiversity relates to long-term,
   predictable, sustainable, traditional uses. The ending of such
   traditions has now happened in many regions and taking place rapidly
   across much of Europe. Sudden, dramatic and often unexpected changes
   occur and massive declines of biodiversity result. With environments
   transformed by human activity, the eco-cultural landscapes in
   traditional or customary management hold much of the most significant
   wildlife resources. The ending of traditional and customary management,
   termed 'cultural severance' (Rotherham 2008), is probably the most
   serious threat for nature conservation in the twenty-first century, at
   least in the medium-term, the impacts exceeding those of climate change.
   The transformations now happening also have major implications for rural
   human communities and their economies. Observational studies and
   cross-disciplinary research across Europe highlights the urgent need to
   recognise the eco-cultural nature of landscapes and to establish
   inventories and conservation programmes for important bio-cultural
   heritage. This paper results from long-term historical research,
   scientific analysis of case studies, and international researcher
   collaborations to present ideas and paradigms relating to emerging
   concepts and visions.</td>

   Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, manages a large population of trees that
   provide important ecosystem services and cultural heritage values.
   Between 1997 and 2009 Melbourne was affected by a serious drought
   resulting in significant tree health decline. Elms and planes in
   particular, were badly affected. This paper presents data from a survey
   of tree health status, and of studies of retrofitted buried drip line
   irrigation. A study of soil wetting in autumn of 2009 found that the use
   of drip irrigation had, in most cases, little or no effect on soil
   moisture levels and a modeled study of tree water use showed that water
   delivered by drip irrigation provided only a fraction of the water
   required by a mature tree. By contrast, drip irrigation in late winter
   was able to recharge soil moisture levels. Mechanisms responsible for
   the decline in tree health seen during the drought are discussed. While
   the drought has temporarily been alleviated, climate change scenarios
   for southern Australia suggest that increased rainfall variability and
   drought events will be more common. The experiences gained during the
   recent drought event provide useful information for urban tree managers
   planning for the future.</td>

   potentially valuable for maintaining biodiversity within linked
   social-ecological systems, and cultural landscapes in particular.
   However, IEK is declining globally, along with biodiversity. Adaptive
   co-management frameworks incorporating both Indigenous and scientific
   knowledge systems have the capacity for greater success than frameworks
   embedded within a singular world view. A major challenge exists,
   however, in identifying pathways for the integration of these knowledge
   systems. The need to integrate both IEK and science into management is
   widely recognised; various approaches have been trialled but there are
   few successful examples. Cooperative research using joint learning is
   emerging as one potentially useful approach. Here we present an example
   of applying co-research in a cultural landscape in Australia, the Wet
   Tropics World Heritage Area, where we aimed to develop linked cultural
   and biophysical indicators of ecosystem condition. Our approach was
   founded on five stakeholder-defined core principles for research. The
   study revealed seven determinants of successful implementation within
   these principles: strong Indigenous governance; problem-framing and
   conceptualisation; relationship building; data collection and
   management; considerations of scale; agreed dissemination of results;
   and evaluation. We identify cooperative problem-framing as one of the
   most important determinants, and argue that by starting the co-research
   process with this task, co-research can assist the equitable convergence
   of IEK and contemporary natural resource management, thereby potentially
   enhancing social-ecological system resilience and sustainability.</td>

   by sea-level rise and coastal flooding. Some of these vulnerable lands
   contain significant archeological sites and cultural resources. The
   accurate calculation of shoreline rates of change and identification of
   coastal hazard zones for areas containing cultural resources is crucial
   for the development of effective coastal zone management strategies that
   address resource conservation and preservation. This investigation
   employed geospatial and analytical statistical techniques to conduct a
   shoreline change study on Rainsford Island occurring from 1944 to 2008.
   The 4.45-ha island, located in Boston Harbor, Massachusetts, consists of
   two heavily eroded drumlins connected by a low-lying bar. Past
   archeological surveys have concluded that Rainsford Island has numerous
   historical sites and is an area of high prehistoric sensitivity. A
   recent geophysical survey mapped a Revolutionary War era cemetery on the
   island. Multiple data sources were integrated, including historical
   maps, aerial photographs, and airborne laser topographic data for
   shoreline delineation over various temporal and spatial scales. The
   Digital Shoreline Analysis System was used to determine rate-of-change
   statistics and distances, and to identify hotspot areas of erosion and
   accretion. The results show that the island eroded during the study
   period at a rate of 0.05 m/y on average, with erosion rates as high as
   -0.59 m/y. The bar has migrated SE resulting in erosion along the
   island's northern shoreline. Predictive modeling indicates that 26% of
   the island would become inundated with 1 m of sea-level rise including
   the area containing the cemetery.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This article reports findings from an empirical study of the impacts of
   drought on rural households in southeastern Alberta, Canada during the
   1930s. In that decade, extreme summer heat conditions and low
   precipitation levels led to repeated crop failures. These extreme
   climatic conditions coincided with economic recession, falling commodity
   prices, and rising unemployment to create widespread hardship and
   suffering across the rural population. Thousands of households adapted
   by leaving the drought-stricken region and migrating to more northerly
   regions unaffected by drought, often suffering still further hardship as
   they reestablished themselves in a new environment. Through secondary
   research of historical documents and interviews with surviving migrants
   and non-migrants, this study identifies how economic, human, and social
   capital influenced the adaptive capacity, adaptation decisions, and
   migration behavior of rural households and describes how institutional
   responses affected household adaptation. Differential access to capital
   in its various forms was a key factor that distinguished households that
   adapted via migration from those that did not. The findings from this
   study of historical environment-related population change provide
   insights that enhance our broader understanding of potential future
   migration responses to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change and
   important considerations for policy-makers and planners seeking to build
   adaptive capacity in rural populations.</td>

   the environmental record often neglected by policy makers and
   environmental planners when considering the impact of climate change;
   where cultural heritage has been considered in the past, an emphasis has
   been placed on the historic built environment and major monuments.
   Through studying the recent past, particularly the last 1,000 years,
   geomorphologists and geoarchaeologists can add much empirical data to
   these debates concerning system response. In addition to the impact of
   the changing intensity and pattern of natural geomorphic processes,
   human response to climate change ranging from new farming practices
   through to the implementation of mitigation strategies to minimise the
   effects of increased flood frequency and magnitude could be equally as
   damaging to the archaeological record if not managed through informed

   archaeological sites, historic buildings, and cultural landscapes can be
   examined through quantitatively-based analyses encompassing large data
   samples and broad geographic and temporal scales. The Digital Index of
   North American Archaeology (DINAA) is a multi-institutional
   collaboration that allows researchers online access to linked heritage
   data from multiple sources and data sets. The effects of sea-level rise
   and concomitant human population relocation is examined using a sample
   from nine states encompassing much of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of
   the southeastern United States. A 1 m rise in sea-level will result in
   the loss of over &gt;13,000 recorded historic and prehistoric
   archaeological sites, as well as over 1000 locations currently eligible
   for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP),
   encompassing archaeological sites, standing structures, and other
   cultural properties. These numbers increase substantially with each
   additional 1 m rise in sea level, with &gt;32,000 archaeological sites and
   &gt;2400 NRHP properties lost should a 5 m rise occur. Many more unrecorded
   archaeological and historic sites will also be lost as large areas of
   the landscape are flooded. The displacement of millions of people due to
   rising seas will cause additional impacts where these populations
   resettle. Sea level rise will thus result in the loss of much of the
   record of human habitation of the coastal margin in the Southeast within
   the next one to two centuries, and the numbers indicate the magnitude of
   the impact on the archaeological record globally. Construction of large
   linked data sets is essential to developing procedures for sampling,
   triage, and mitigation of these impacts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Increasing globalization has promoted the spread of exotic species,
   including disease vectors. Understanding the evolutionary processes
   involved in such colonizations is both of intrinsic biological interest
   and important to predict and mitigate future disease risks. The Aedes
   aegypti mosquito is a major vector of dengue, chikungunya and Zika, the
   worldwide spread of which has been facilitated by Ae. aegypti's adaption
   to human-modified environments. Understanding the evolutionary processes
   involved in this invasion requires characterization of the genetic
   make-up of the source population (s). The application of approximate
   Bayesian computation (ABC) to sequence data from four nuclear and one
   mitochondrial marker revealed that African populations of Ae. aegypti
   best fit a demographic model of lineage diversification, historical
   admixture and recent population structuring. As ancestral Ae. aegypti
   were dependent on forests, this population history is consistent with
   the effects of forest fragmentation and expansion driven by Pleistocene
   climatic change. Alternatively, or additionally, historical human
   movement across the continent may have facilitated their recent spread
   and mixing. ABC analysis and haplotype networks support earlier
   inferences of a single out-of-Africa colonization event, while a cline
   of decreasing genetic diversity indicates that Ae. aegypti moved first
   from Africa to the Americas and then to Asia. ABC analysis was unable to
   verify this colonization route, possibly because the genetic signal of
   admixture obscures the true colonization pathway. By increasing genetic
   diversity and forming novel allelic combinations, divergence and
   historical admixture within Africa could have provided the adaptive
   potential needed for the successful worldwide spread of Ae. aegypti.</td>

   local level. Focusing on the Yuanyang Terrace of SW China (a very famous
   agricultural heritage site), this study illustrates that land use
   change, dynamic adaptation and Public-Private Partnership (PPP) are the
   main measures to reduce the drought disaster risk and have the important
   role in adapting to droughts based on methodology of the land use
   survey, household questionnaire, local government and companies'

   Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) was proposed in spatial, temporal and
   social dimensions. It is a good practice to adapt to disaster risk and
   agricultural heritage conservation by tourism development. Adaptive risk
   management is more important in adapting to disaster risk in order to
   maintain heritages conservation and local livelihood improvement.</td>

   widespread endemic New Guinean forest pademelons (Thylogale) based on
   current taxonomy and zoogeography (northern, southern and montane
   species groupings) and preliminary genetic findings (western and eastern
   regional groupings) are investigated using mitochondrial sequence data.
   We examine the relationship between the observed phylogeographical
   structure and known or inferred geological and historical environmental
   change during the late Tertiary and Quaternary.Location New Guinea and
   associated islands.Methods We used primarily museum specimen collections
   to sample representatives from Thylogale populations across New Guinea
   and three associated islands. Mitochondrial cytochrome b and control
   region sequence data were used to construct phylogenies and estimate the
   timing of population divergence.Results Phylogenetic analyses indicated
   subdivision of pademelons into 'eastern' and 'western' regional clades.
   This was largely due to the genetic distinctiveness of north-eastern and
   eastern peninsula populations, as the 'western' clade included samples
   from the northern, southern and central regions of New Guinea. Two
   tested island groups were closely related to populations north of the
   Central Cordillera; low genetic differentiation of pademelon populations
   between north-eastern New Guinea and islands of the Bismarck Archipelago
   is consistent with late Pleistocene human-mediated translocations, while
   the Aru Islands population showed divergence consistent with cessation
   of gene flow in the mid Pleistocene. There was relatively limited
   genetic divergence between currently geographically isolated populations
   in subalpine and nearby mid-montane or lowland regions.Main conclusions
   Phylogeographical structuring does not conform to zoogeographical
   expectations of a north/south division across the cordillera, nor to
   current species designations, for this generalist forest species
   complex. Instead, the observed genetic structuring of Thylogale
   populations has probably been influenced by geological changes and
   Pleistocene climatic changes, in particular the recent uplift of the
   north-eastern Huon Peninsula and the lowering of tree lines during
   glacial periods. Low sea levels during glacial maxima also allowed gene
   flow between the continental Aru Island group and New Guinea. More work
   is needed, particularly multi-taxon comparative studies, to further
   develop and test phylogeographical hypotheses in New Guinea.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Lake St Lucia in South Africa is part of a UNESCO World Heritage site
   and a Ramsar wetland of international importance. Like many coastal
   wetlands worldwide, anthropogenic activities including catchment
   land-use changes, water diversions/abstractions, and manipulation of the
   mouth state have significantly affected its functioning over the past
   century. Questions concerning its sustainability have motivated a
   reevaluation of management decisions made in the past and of options for
   the future. A model for the water and salt budgets has therefore been
   used to investigate "what if' scenarios in terms of past anthropogenic
   interventions. In particular, simulations allow us to evaluate the
   effects of diverting the Mfolozi river from St Lucia on the functioning
   of the system and on the occurrence of various water level/salinity
   states that drive the biological functioning of the ecosystem. In the
   past, when the St Lucia estuary and the Mfolozi river had a combined
   inlet, the mouth was predominantly open. The lake had relatively stable
   water levels but variable salinities that increased during dry
   conditions due to evaporative losses and saltwater inflows from the sea.
   If the mouth closed, the Mfolozi flow was diverted into the lake which
   reduced salinities and maintained or increased water levels. Simulations
   indicate that without a link to the Mfolozi the lake system would
   naturally have a mainly closed inlet with lower average salinities but
   more variable water levels. During dry conditions water levels would
   reduce and result in desiccation of large areas of the lake as has
   recently occurred. We conclude that the artificial separation of the St
   Lucia and Mfolozi inlets underpins the most significant impacts on the
   water &amp; salt budget of the lake and that its reversal is key to the
   sustainability of the system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The varied and very dynamic landscape with a high biological diversity
   is a distinctive feature of the Curonian spit at the regional scale.
   Throughout the 20th century the main morphodynamic trend in the littoral
   of the Curonian spit was shoreline grading on the lagoon side, whereas
   on the marine side the increasing erosion at the foot of the spit, and
   increasing accretion at the head of the spit prevailed. The results of a
   discriminant analysis (Wilkes' lambda=0.001626 and F=29.267 when p &lt;
   0.001) show that sites with prevailing erosion, accretion and sediment
   input from the drifting dunes form regular inter-related spatial
   structures in the littoral with distinctive resulting discontinuities of
   the sediment drift along the lagoon coast. Dune littoral cells are
   characterized by Aeolian sediment input and distribution 'down-drift',
   (usually northwards) from the source. The most likely changes in the
   current development trends of the lagoon shore zone of the Curonian spit
   are related to expected climate changes and further slowing down of the
   dune drift. The probability of storms and ice-drift events, and their
   impact on coasts is expected to increase as a result of climate change.
   The dune advance will gradually slow down, and with it, the sand input
   to the coastal zone will decline. In this paper, we define integrated
   shoreline management as a system of long-term shoreline management
   measures, which is based on a littoral cell approach and aimed at
   harmonizing human activity in the coastal zone with the natural
   development of the shoreline. We propose an integrated management
   program for the lagoon shoreline of the Curonian spit, which is
   site-specific for each littoral cell as a coastal management unit.
   Drifting dunes and seaside beaches are the natural amenities, which are
   best known and best appreciated on the Curonian spit by 49% of the
   respondents representing the total Lithuanian population. A responsible
   tourism development should be considered as the key means for proper
   appreciation of the drifting dunes and natural coasts by society, which
   means to acknowledge and cherish the aesthetic and conservation values
   of dune and coastal landscapes of the Curonian spit as a World Heritage
   Site. There are at least two pre-conditions for this: (1) to provide
   visitors with sufficient information about diverse values and functions
   of the Curonian dunes and coasts within a broader regional and global
   heritage conservation context; (2) to enable tourists to enjoy the most
   impressive dune and coastal landscapes at close range. In this paper we
   propose to encourage active dune tourism, to reintroduce grazing into
   the Curonian dune areas, to restore and to preserve the most impressive
   landscapes of the highest white drifting dunes by bringing the blown out
   sand from the leeward foot of the dunes back to the crest artificially.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The coastal zone of The Gambia consists of 70 km open ocean coast and
   200 km sheltered coast. Only about 20 km of the open coastline is
   significantly developed and this includes Banjul (the capital city),
   Bakau and Cape St. Mary, Fajara and the Tourism Development Area (TDA).
   Tourism is the most important economic sector in the coastal zone and
   contributes about 10% of the government revenue. Fisheries and
   agriculture are also important coastal industries. In this study the
   Aerial Videotape-assisted Vulnerability Analysis (AVVA) technique has
   been used to provide a detailed analysis of vulnerability to sea level
   rise, and adaptation strategies have been identified. The data used
   includes a video recording of the coastline, color infrared and black
   and white aerial photography, topographic maps, bathymetric maps, a
   geological map of The Gambia and still photographs. The data have been
   used to characterize the coastal zone into 9 geomorphological units,
   wherein the cultural and heritage sites of economic importance have been
   delineated and characterized according to their biophysical and economic
   importance. Future erosion rates have been projected by applying the
   Bruun Rule, and future total land loss due to inundation in response to
   global warming and accelerated sea level rise has been determined. The
   sea level rise scenarios considered are 0.2 m, 0.5 m, and 1.0 m per
   century. Inundation is estimated to be about 92.32 x 10(6) m(2) for a
   1.0 m sea level rise, 45.89 x 10(6) m(2) for a 0.5 m sea level rise and
   4.96 x 10(6) m(2) for a 0.2 m sea level rise. The greater part of this
   area lost will be wetlands and mangrove systems important for fish
   spawning areas and habitats for wildlife. Shoreline retreat is estimated
   to vary between about 6.8 m in cliffy areas to about 880 m for more flat
   and sandy areas based on the Bruun Rule. Population and physical
   structures at risk have been determined. Attempts have been made to
   report this loss in monetary terms, but firm figures are not yet
   available. Only one unit of the coastal zone has been evaluated. In this
   unit, it is expected that the capital city will be completely lost
   through both erosion and inundation within 50 to 60 yr with a total of
   42000 persons displaced. Lands and physical structures to be lost are
   estimated at US$ 217 million. Response strategies and adaptation options
   identified include: innovative sand management, building and
   rehabilitation of groins, construction of revetments to protect
   important areas, construction of sea-walls/bulkheads, public outreach
   and awareness, building regulations and urban growth planning, wetland
   preservation and mitigation, and development of a coastal zone
   management plan.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Despite the growing body of research on the concept of adaptive
   capacity, there is an absence of research which investigates adaptive
   capacity in the field of cultural heritage management. Climatic changes
   have potentially serious implications for the historic environment,
   which is itself a non-renewable resource. Cultural heritage sites can be
   particularly sensitive to severe weather events and to changes in
   climate, both due to direct impacts on built structures, archaeology and
   designed landscapes, but also due to changes in visitor behaviour and
   the potentially adverse implications of adaptive measures on heritage
   significance. This research investigated the adaptive capacity of the
   management of cultural heritage sites in the UK. The research
   methodology and a final conceptual framework of adaptive capacity
   relevant for heritage management are presented in this paper.An initial
   framework of adaptive capacity was developed through an examination of
   key literature, a scoping study and a questionnaire survey. This was
   then tested and refined through the assessment of adaptive capacity at
   three UK World Heritage Sites, the analysis of national and
   international policy and interviews with stakeholders at the national
   and international level. The process of analysis and development of a
   revised conceptual framework gave insights into some of the challenges
   of investigating adaptive capacity. The key determinants of adaptive
   capacity in the final framework, found to affect the capacity to adapt
   to climate change at cultural heritage sites, are cognitive factors,
   leadership, learning capacity, access to information, authority and
   resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The origin and course of the Neolithic on the Arabian Peninsula is the
   subject of an ongoing academic debate. Faunal data suggest an origin for
   domestication of animals in the Levant and these can be found in Arabia
   from the sixth millennium onwards. In contrast, lithic evidence does not
   support the hypothesis that Neolithic herders, accompanying their herds,
   spread over the entire Peninsula, as they did not leave significant
   traces of their material culture. Although Pre-Pottery Neolithic A
   (PPNA)/PPNB influences can be traced across the northern part of Arabia,
   it is barely possible to observe them further south. By contrast, lithic
   technology in this region is characterised by major indigenous
   developments that might originate from a Pleistocene cultural heritage.
   By discussing the process of Neolithisation in Arabia from different
   points of view we can avoid the pitfalls of simplistic or monocausal
   models as well as preconceptions. Furthermore, we will be able to
   demonstrate that the Neolithic developed differently in different
   regions of the Arabian Peninsula.</td>

   Therefore, the prediction of the evolution of Brazilian beef cattle
   production cost was made using the IPCC forecast scenario for global
   warming. The methodology consisted of two steps: (i) the development of
   a fuzzy model that estimated the grazing land capacity (RP) decrease
   risk as a function of the changes in the average total rain index, air
   temperature and increase in extension of the dry season; and (ii) the
   design of an algorithm for predicting the decrease in production as
   function of the RP fuzzy model, that results in the impact in beef
   cattle productivity, and consequent increase in production costs.
   Historical environmental data from important producing counties in the
   Cerrado were organized and a set of fuzzy Gaussian functions were
   developed, and three possible settings (optimistic, medium and
   pessimistic) were considered. The decrease in beef cattle productivity
   was estimated using the losses in production due to the increase in air
   temperature and vulnerability of pasture capacity. The boundary settings
   for the total increase of production cost scenario used the number of
   animals per area of grazing land, the adoption of grain supplement and
   its future scenario; and the result output function pointed to a
   threshold within a variation from an increase in production cost of 80%
   (optimistic) to 160% (pessimistic). Under the optimistic scenario the
   total cost of Brazilian beef cattle production in the Cerrado became
   near to US$ 2.88 kg(-1), while in the pessimistic scenario this cost
   reached US$ 4.16 kg(-1), challenging the international competitiveness
   of this economic segment.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>There are several reasons for severe land and terrace degradation in the
   Maltese Islands, The main reason is the land abandonment which took
   place from the 1960s. Cultivated fields have constant protection against
   soil erosion by the crops and the farmer's care for both the field
   itself and the field terraces, as well as the rubble walls which are
   part of the cultural heritage in the maltese Islands. Once a rubble wall
   is broken down, intensive soil erosion starts because then the tracks
   for the erosion processes are pre-determined.. Usually the natural
   vegetation is able to reclaim abandoned land in a short period, but the
   dry, hot, and windy climate in the Maltese Islands creates unfavourable
   conditions. Starting in autumn every year rainstorms occur and cover the
   mainly unprotected land with flash floods. Meanwhile it is proven that
   global climate change is producing heavier rainfall than in previous
   decades.With the help of old aerial photographs (1957) and high
   resolution satellite images (Tkonos, 2004) the percentage of abandoned
   land in the Gnejna Valley in Malta was determined. A Digital Elevation
   Model gave, via relief analysis, the possibility to assess the possible
   erosion tracks on an island which has no perennial streams. Field
   research gave major insight to the composition of the vegetation cover
   on the abandoned field terraces and other parts of the valley. The
   results are a forerunner to a solution to the problem in the entire
   Maltese Islands as well as, probably, other Mediterranean Islands with a
   dry climate.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A combined mineral magnetic and scaled chrysophyte study of lake
   sediments from Lake Lacawac and Lake Giles in northeastern Pennsylvania
   was conducted to determine the effects of land-use and sediment source
   changes on the variation of pH, conductivity, and alkalinity inferred
   from biotic changes. Ten 30-40 cm long gravity cores were collected from
   Lake Lacawac and three from Lake Giles. Isothermal remanent
   magnetizations (IRMs) were given to the lake sediments in a 1.3 T
   magnetic field to measure magnetic mineral concentration variations. IRM
   acquisition experiments were conducted to identify magnetic mineralogy.
   The bedrock, soils and a peat bog on the shores of Lake Lacawac were
   also sampled for magnetic analysis to determine possible lake sediment
   sources. The top 10 cm of sediment collected from Lakes Lacawac and
   Giles was two to four times more magnetic than deeper sediment. Pb-210
   dating suggests that this intensity increase commenced circa 1900. SEM
   images of magnetic extracts from the highly magnetic sediments indicates
   the presence of magnetic fly ash microspheres from fossil fuel burning
   electric power generation plants. The similarity in magnetic coercivity
   in the top 8 cm lake sediments and in the peat bog supports an
   atmospheric source for some of the magnetic minerals in the youngest
   lake sediments. The highly magnetic sediments also contain an
   antiferromagnetic mineral in two cores closest to Lake Lacawac's
   southeastern shore. This magnetic mineral is only present deep in the
   soil profile and would suggest erosion and significant land-use changes
   in the Lacawac watershed as another cause for the high magnetic
   intensities (concentrations) in the top 10 cm of the lake sediments. The
   most significant changes in the scaled chrysophyte flora occurred
   immediately above the 10 cm level and were used to infer a doubling of
   the specific conductivity between circa 1910 and 1929. These variations
   also support land-use changes in the Lacawac catchment at this time. A
   similar shift in the scaled chrysophte flora was not observed in the top
   of Lake Giles, however, distinct changes were found in the deeper
   sections of the core coupled with a smaller peak in magnetic
   concentration. Fourier analysis of the Pb-210-dated lake sediment
   magnetics indicates the presence of a 50 year period, low amplitude
   variation in the Lake Lacawac, Lake Giles, and Lake Waynewood (Lott et
   al., 1994) magnetic concentration records. After removal of the
   land-use/fly ash magnetic concentration peak by Gaussian filtering, the
   50 year variation correlates strongly from lake to lake even though the
   lakes are in different watersheds separated by up to 30 km. When this
   magnetic variation is compared with Gaussian-filtered rainfall
   variations observed in New York City and Philadelphia over the past
   120-250 years there is a strong correlation suggesting that magnetic
   concentration variations can record regional rainfall variations with an
   approximately 50 year period. This result indicates that magnetics could
   be used to document regional variations in climatic change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This study concerns the analysis of the Valea Oii watershed and the
   dynamics of human settlement depending on the occurrence of natural risk
   factors and their evolution. These include climatic change fluctuations,
   and appearance of new hydrological resources like springs, from
   consequent landslides, the disappearance of forests as a direct effect
   from overexploitation of the land. Archaeological sites and current
   villages have been investigated, as well as their emplacement depending
   on natural hazards (such as floods, landslides and gully erosion). At
   the same time, we have also indexed the water sources which include
   streams, springs and man-made lakes. The first archaeological records
   date back to the Chalcolithic period. The entire catchment includes a
   total of 26 Chalcolithic archaeological sites which are continuously
   threatened by numerous natural or anthropic risks. The
   morpho-hydrographic, geologic, and pedologic particularities have
   determined an early occupation of the area situated in the upper part of
   the watershed. In ancient times, the lower sector of the valley and the
   floodplain was used for agricultural purpose or for pasturing.
   Throughout time, human settlements shifted gradually towards the lower
   area. This phenomenon was triggered by significant deforestation, which
   led to an extension of the pastures and of the agricultural land. In the
   modern period, most settlements moved towards areas that were submitted
   to flooding. This process was determined by the escalation of landslides
   and by gully erosion which began after deforestation. In order to
   protect the floodplain settlements, dams were built to reduce the
   effects of high waters. One of the main advantages of studying small
   catchments is that the results can be extrapolated for larger catchments
   (&gt; 100 km(2)), the volume of analyzed data being smaller, but done with
   the same strictness. Therefore, the results of this study can surely
   provide important information and can save relevant archaeological and
   geographical data in a GIS which, in normal present conditions, would
   not be possible to be recovered in the future.</td>

   and PM10), corrosion (cast bronze) and recession (Portland limestone),
   exceedance of tolerable degradation thresholds for each material and
   corrosion-cultural heritage overlapped maps. The model and the
   methodology developed could be useful if apply it to towns, regions or

   century-old historic huts of the Heroic Period of exploration in the
   Ross Dependency 1898-1917 and fungi in pristine terrestrial locations.
   The motivation of the research was initially to identify potential
   fungal causes of degradation of the historic huts and artifacts. The
   research was extended to study fungal presence at pristine sites for
   comparison purposes and to consider the role of fungi in the respective
   ecosystems. We employed classical microbiology for isolation of viable
   organisms, and culture-independent DNA analyses. The research provided
   baseline data on microbial biodiversity. Principal findings were that
   there is significant overlap of the yeasts and filamentous fungi
   isolated from the historic sites, soil, and historic-introduced
   materials (i.e., wood, foodstuffs) and isolated from environmental
   samples in pristine locations. Aerial spore monitoring confirmed that
   winter spore counts were high and, in some cases, similar to those found
   in summer. Microbial diversity varied between the three Ross Island
   historic sites, and one historic site showed noticeably higher
   diversity, which led to the conclusion that this is a variable that
   should not be generalized. Cultured fungi were cold active, and the
   broader scientific significance of this finding was that climate change
   (warming) may not adversely affect these fungal species unless they were
   out-competed by new arrivals or unfavorable changes in ecosystem
   domination occur.</td>

   impacted natural processes typically requires good time series for the
   environmental change. Unfortunately, other than for climate, detailed
   time series of historical environments are scarce. In many instances,
   researchers can only collate disparate and sometimes fragmented
   information from the literature or from historical or pre-historical
   sources.2. Here, we apply modern statistical methods to reconstruct a
   recent historical time series of environmental change from sparse data
   collected from heterogeneous sources. Specifically, we deal with record
   irregularity and the varying levels of uncertainty associated with each
   datum using state-space models in a hierarchical Bayesian framework.3.
   As an example, we reconstruct a time series of a simple landscape
   feature (hedgerow length) over a large spatial scale (Britain) over a
   long-time period (50 years), by combining both stock estimates and rate
   of change estimates, gathered from different historical sources.4. We
   illustrate the utility of the method by relating the population trends
   of a hedgerow-nesting passerine bird, the yellowhammer Emberiza
   citrinella to the reconstructed trends in hedgerow length. Population
   density was closely related to hedgerow availability, suggesting a
   potential key role for nesting habitat loss in the yellowhammer
   decline.5. The modelling framework we used is flexible and general. The
   method can be adapted to reconstruct time series of any environmental
   variables from a variety of sparse and heterogeneous historical sources.</td>

   evidence for an advance in both first and peak flowering dates and
   flowering was closely related to temperature, which had risen
   substantially in this area. Similar advances have been reported from
   elsewhere, but typically from human-modified habitats. A comparison with
   contemporary data from the UK suggests that flowering was both later and
   less responsive in Poland. Examination of the data from the 2 countries

   role of cultural heritage in sustainable development, they develop only
   on theoretical level. The answer to the main question, that is if the
   cultural landscape can play a role in sustainable development, could be
   positive only if we are able to produce empirical evidence about its
   contribution to improve economic, social, and environmental productivity
   of the city. It is necessary to produce empirical evidence to
   demonstrate that cultural heritage conservation/valorization is an
   investment and not a cost. To date, there are few researches about the
   indicators that are able to support the relationship between cultural
   heritage conservation/regeneration and sustainable development. This
   paper intends to go beyond this limit and approach this issue in
   operational terms. It is focused on the role that cultural heritage can
   play in the sustainable development framework. An assessment framework
   that is able to capture the multidimensional benefits of cultural
   landscape conservation/valorization is proposed here starting from the
   analysis of 40 case studies of culture-led regeneration projects. A
   matrix of multidimensional indicators (divided into nine categories)
   about the impacts produced by these 40 cultural heritage
   conservation/valorization projects and its critical analysis is here
   proposed, mainly focusing the attention on the double relationship
   between the tourism sector and climate change. Although the analyses
   often refer to sustainability, it is not concretely addressed because
   there is an imbalance among the dimensions: in most cases, only the
   economic component is highlighted, leaving out the social and
   environmental dimensions. Furthermore, the impacts related to
   cultural-led projects are mainly interpreted in terms of tourism and
   real estate impacts.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The relations between humans and animals extend into socio-cultural
   aspects that go beyond the mere acquisition of food, meaning that
   animals constitute cultural resources that fulfill diverse roles in
   social and cultural systems. Visual images in different media, including
   rock art, represent one of the ways in which these complex relationships
   take place. While in the New World few comparative analyses of
   archaeofaunal and visual data have been addressed, in the Old World
   these studies have been framed by a dichotomist view between drawn
   (thought) and consumed (eaten) understanding, both terms as separate and
   disconnected social realms. This view also structures an abstract,
   non-pragmatic, rather passive, world drawn in art, against a concrete,
   practical, active world of consumption. The analysis we present here,
   based on principles of substantive economy theory, explores the relation
   between humans and animals in the prehistory of the Atacama Desert (ca.
   13,000-410 BP), by comparing visual images of fauna depicted in rock art
   (engravings and paintings) with archaeofaunal remains from domestic and
   funerary contexts. The dataset (comprised of 1534 archaeofaunal items
   and 729 rock art animal motifs from 117 sites) was standardized by
   calculating the percentage of ubiquity of each animal item per period of
   time, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to identify
   synchronic and diachronic changes in the relative importance of certain
   animals consumed. We observed important temporal and contextual
   variations in the consumption of animals drawn in rock art in the
   Atacama Desert, and we conclude that they reflect a selection of a wide
   range of ritual and utilitarian, but not mutually exclusive, functions.
   In particular, images of camelids emphasized the importance of providing
   fiber for the creation of textile artifacts and camelid use as pack
   animals in the caravan trade, both activities that were fundamental in
   the economy of local societies. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Background: Climatic changes during glacial periods have had a major
   influence on the recent evolutionary history of living organisms, even
   in temperate forests on islands, where the land was not covered with ice
   sheets. We investigated the phylogeographical patterns of the weevil
   Curculio sikkimensis (Curculionidae), a generalist seed predator of
   Fagaceae plants living in both deciduous oak and evergreen forests of
   Japan. Its genetic structure was compared to that of another
   host-specific seed predator, C. hilgendorfi, inhabiting only evergreen
   forests.Results: We examined 921 bp of mitochondrial DNA for 115
   individuals collected from 33 populations of C. sikkimensis from 11
   plant species of three genera, Quercus, Lithocarpus, and Castanopsis. An
   analysis of molecular variance revealed that a large proportion (almost
   50%, P &lt; 0.001) of the total genetic variance could be explained by
   differences between two geographical regions, the southwestern and
   northeastern parts of the main islands of Japan. In contrast, no
   significant genetic differentiation of the weevil was observed among
   vegetation types of their utilized host plant species. The
   phylogeographical patterns of the generalist and the host-specific seed
   predator exhibited a congruent genetic boundary in the Chugoku-Shikoku
   region.Conclusion: Our results suggest that geology and historical
   environment have contributed to shaping the present genetic structure of
   C. sikkimensis. The geographical patterns of genetic differentiation in
   the Chugoku-Shikoku region observed in the two types of
   Fagaceae-associated Curculio in this study have also been observed in
   several plant species growing in warm and cool temperate zones of Japan.
   The occurrence of this common pattern suggests that deciduous oak and
   evergreen forests of Japan survived together, or adjacent to each other,
   in small refugia during glacial ages, in the southwestern and
   northeastern parts of the main islands, although these two types of
   forests are presently distributed in cool and warm temperate zones of
   Japan, respectively.</td>

   on fire prone landscapes within the UNESCO World Heritage Properties
   require the application of wildfire risk assessment at landscape level.
   The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial variation of
   wildfire risk on Holy Mount Athos in Greece. Mt. Athos includes 20
   monasteries and other structures that are threatened by increasing
   frequency of wildfires. Site-specific fuel models were created by
   measuring in the field several fuel parameters in representative natural
   fuel complexes, while the spatial extent of the fuel types was
   determined using a synergy of high-resolution imagery and high temporal
   information from medium spatial resolution imagery classified through
   object-based analysis and a machine learning classifier. The Minimum
   Travel Time (MTT) algorithm, as it is embedded in FlamMap software, was
   applied in order to evaluate Burn Probability (BP), Conditional Flame
   Length (CFL), Fire Size (FS), and Source-Sink Ratio (SSR). The results
   revealed low burn probabilities for the monasteries; however, nine out
   of the 20 monasteries have high fire potential in terms of fire
   intensity, which means that if an ignition occurs, an intense fire is
   expected. The outputs of this study may be used for decision-making for
   short-term predictions of wildfire risk at an operational level,
   contributing to fire suppression and management of UNESCO World Heritage
   Properties.</td>

   despite associated practical limitations and challenges as a development
   strategy. Using the case of Cambodia, this paper illustrates how
   sustainable tourism issues in a developing country may be better
   understood through a systematic review of scattered relevant
   peer-reviewed and grey literature. This can help in identifying emergent
   themes and challenges, gaps in knowledge, and opportunities for future
   research. Analysis of 77 documents on Cambodia's sustainable tourism
   revealed themes and challenges relating to: (1) an emphasis on
   nature-based tourism (ecotourism); (2) calls for greater community
   engagement for sustainable outcomes; (3) stakeholder perceptions and
   values as drivers of tourism success; (4) cultural heritage as a key
   tourism attraction; and (5) foreign investment shaping Cambodia's
   tourism future. Unequal emphasis is given to key government policies for
   tourism development and there is limited practical guidance on how to
   realise a vision of sustainable tourism. There is a lack of
   consideration of how the socio-economic and cultural context affects
   sustainable tourism. The evidence suggests that sustainable tourism in
   Cambodia is questionable until fundamental economic, social capacity and
   policy issues are addressed, along with greater emphasis given to the
   tourism system's demand side.</td>

   during extreme rainfall events under the historical environment using
   the grid-Cell Distributed Rainfall Run-off Model Version 3 (CDRMV3).
   Historical land use maps were digitised using the Palaeoland-Use
   Reconstruction (PLUR) programme as the input data for CDRMV3.
   Palaeoflood simulations show the delay and the reduction of the peak
   discharge under 1902 land use in the Kamo River basin because of
   increases in coverage of forest and paddy fields compared with 1976 land
   use. Lower discharge and earlier peak discharge time are estimated under
   historical land use and compared with conditions under present land use.
   The results of the palaeoflood simulations under extreme rainfall events
   create a better understanding of palaeoenvironmental conditions and
   their potential impact on flood management while suggesting important
   implications for resource management under land use and climate change.</td>

   moisture, and consequently swelling and shrinking. Differences in the
   moisture response of the materials induce internal stresses in the
   individual layers of the structures, which cause objects to deform and

   damage of the design layer on wood due to repeated RH variations is
   quantified in terms of their magnitude and number of times they occur.
   The climatological risk index for accumulated, 'fatigue' damage is
   established, using a procedure to reduce irregular real-world climate
   histories into simple RH cycles of known damage impact. Using output
   from the Hadley Model (HadCM3) and simple transfer functions predicting
   indoor temperature and RH from outdoor climate, changes in the indoor
   climate through to 2100 were forecast for unheated buildings. European

   the preservation of cultural heritage. Here we present two
   palaeo-records from the Lore Lindu Biosphere Reserve and National Park
   in central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The park comprises one of the largest
   remaining and most biodiverse mountain forests of Sulawesi. Outstanding
   megalithic sites reveal long-term human impact on the area. Thus, modern
   vegetation composition within the park has been determined by complex
   site histories, natural and anthropogenic. Palaeo-records from sites
   between 1,000 and 1,400 m a.s.l. demonstrate that human activity as well
   as climate variations have to be considered as the main drivers of
   vegetation changes in the region for the last 2,000 years. Human impact
   is reflected by large amounts of charred fragments in the pollen records
   plus low values of arboreal pollen resulting from forest clearance. The
   stratigraphy of one of the pollen records shows effects of a general
   cooling trend during the Little Ice Age (LIA). Biomass loss due to the
   conversion of lower montane rainforest to grassland has reduced the
   carbon storage potential in the area of the Lore Lindu Park.
   Recommendations for conservation policy that may be made from the
   environmental history within the biosphere reserve thus include the
   consideration of human influence in easily accessible areas,
   particularly in face of recent settlement intensification.</td>

   species that is showing symptoms of decline due to anthropic factors
   and, possibly, global warming. ITS sequences were 511 bp long and showed
   low (6.4%) variation among geographically different populations. The
   four selected ISSR primers yielded 93 reproducible bands, of which 91
   (97.9%) were polymorphic in the 97 individual profiles obtained. Total
   genetic diversity (H (T)) and average heterozygosity within populations
   (H (S)) resulted fairly low (0.22 and 0.136, respectively). The
   accession from Wadi Dowkah, an UNESCO world heritage site, showed the
   lowest level of genetic diversity (H (E) = 0.107), while the eastern
   populations from the Hasik area harboured a slightly greater amount of
   variation. Analysis of Molecular Variance showed that differentiation
   among populations was relatively high (38.1%), possibly due to the
   reduced gene flow between the largely isolated stands of Boswellia (N
   (m) = 0.39). Genetic distances and AMOVA suggested a clear
   differentiation between the eastern and western coastal populations,
   while those from the internal area did not form a consistent group. For

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The paper draws from the general literature on energy efficiency and
   historic buildings to explain the importance and potential of
   user-driven energy efficiency in historic buildings. It is the first
   review that places the user as a central object of study in the research
   field of historic buildings and energy efficiency. Relevant
   interdisciplinary topics and research results that make up the core of
   the field are presented and discussed in relation to user behaviour and
   its impact on energy consumption. The paper also investigates how user
   behaviour aspects can be integrated in a procedural approach to energy
   refurbishment in historic buildings. Research and experience from the
   building stock in general clearly shows how a user's awareness and
   behaviour, such as choice of temperature, zone heating and controlled
   airing, can have a significant effect on energy demand yet have no
   physical impact on the building. However, this has not received enough
   attention with regards to the historic building stock, where many
   physical energy efficiency measures can have negative impacts on the
   historic qualities of the building. Modification of user behaviour can
   therefore be a way not only to reduce energy demand but also to minimise
   the physical impact of increasing energy efficiency on historic
   buildings. The paper concludes that the current research agenda on
   historic buildings and energy efficiency has broken much ground but
   remains focused more on technical solutions than bottom-up user
   perspectives. Two main topics are identified as key barriers and future
   research fields: First, energy performance modelling is identified as a
   general barrier to developing sustainable strategies that promote user
   impact in historic buildings. Accurate energy modelling of historic
   buildings is a complex field reliant on the thermal interplay between
   user-building and building-district. Improved knowledge and intensified
   research is necessary to avoid distorted energy modelling results and
   unwanted rebound effects. Practical tools also require that the
   modelling can be used for trade-off scenarios where other sustainability
   aspects such as cultural heritage and economy are weighed in. Second,
   awareness raising in order to foster a deeper understanding and
   knowledge about the construction, system and cultural heritage values of
   a building is proposed as a key ingredient and driver for improved and
   sustainable energy behaviour. The paper argues that while user-driven
   energy efficiency represents an important resource for fostering less
   energy-demanding and less intrusive interventions in historic buildings,
   there are no guarantees for achieving the planned level of energy
   efficiency without taking into account user behaviour and the actual
   operation and energy performance of the historic building. To do this
   without risking negative consequences, improved decision-making
   processes are needed on policy, building and user level. An
   interdisciplinary bottom-up approach to energy refurbishment is
   presented. The essence of the model is that users and residents should
   always play a central role in the decision-making process because the
   well-being of the historic building will always depend on its day-to-day
   users, and vice versa. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   of climate and infrastructure on aquatic ecology and water quality in
   the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. The Delft3D Flexible Mesh modeling
   suite is used in this effort for its 3D hydrodynamics, salinity,
   temperature and sediment dynamics, phytoplankton and water-quality
   coupling infrastructure, and linkage to a habitat suitability model. The
   hydrodynamic model component of the suite is D-Flow FM, a new 3D
   unstructured finite-volume model based on the Delft3D model. In this
   paper, D-Flow FM is applied to the San Francisco Bay-Delta to
   investigate tidal, seasonal and annual dynamics of water levels, river
   flows and salinity under historical environmental and infrastructural
   conditions. The model is driven by historical winds, tides, ocean
   salinity, and river flows, and includes federal, state, and local
   freshwater withdrawals, and regional gate and barrier operations. The
   model is calibrated over a 9-month period, and subsequently validated
   for water levels, flows, and 3D salinity dynamics over a 2 year
   period.Model performance was quantified using several model assessment
   metrics and visualized through target diagrams. These metrics indicate
   that the model accurately estimated water levels, flows, and salinity
   over wide-ranging tidal and fluvial conditions, and the model can be
   used to investigate detailed circulation and salinity patterns
   throughout the Bay-Delta. The hydrodynamics produced through this effort
   will be used to drive affiliated sediment, phytoplankton, and
   contaminant hindcast efforts and habitat suitability assessments for
   fish and bivalves. The modeling framework applied here will serve as a
   baseline to ultimately shed light on potential ecosystem change over the
   current century. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

   are vital to reduce the negative impacts of fire and to facilitate
   planning for the protection of forested areas. This is especially
   important for places with little previous data on fire history. This
   paper presents an improved conceptual scheme for the assessment and
   mapping of fire risk using a Forest Resource Inventory Database, based
   on four aspects of topographical, human activity, climate, and forest
   characteristics factors. We selected 12 variables based on our defined
   conceptual scheme to generate a synthetic forest fire risk index (FRI)
   to quantify potential forest fire risk and map risk zones in the
   Wuyishan Scenery District (WSD), a world heritage site that located in
   the northwest of Fujian province, People's Republic of China. Spatial
   statistics were used to examine the spatio-temporal variation of FRI.
   The results showed the main fire risk zones in the WSD were in the low
   or moderate categories (accounting for 76.7% of the total area of the
   WSD in 1997 and 79.2% in 2009). The spatial heterogeneity of FRI showed
   anisotropic variability characteristics which changed over time. From
   1997 to 2009, there was an increasing influence from both
   autocorrelation factors and random factors. Moreover, these factors
   played almost equally important roles in forest fire processes in the
   WSD. The fire risk map was applied to assess the vulnerability of
   cultural heritage resources in the WSD. Most were located in low- or
   moderate-risk areas, and therefore would be at low risk from potential
   fire damage. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

   interaction of locally driven collaborative efforts with a hierarchy of
   governmental regulation and management and is thought to be capable of
   navigating social-ecological change as society responds to the effects
   of climate change. The assertion of Native American water rights on
   highly developed water systems in North America has triggered governance
   innovations that resemble certain aspects of adaptive governance, and
   have emerged to accommodate the need for Indigenous water development
   and restoration of cultural and ecological resources. Similar

   adaptive processes within complex legal systems. We explore the role of
   law in locally driven innovation in this context, concluding that any
   system of governance that requires greater flexibility will only be
   viewed as legitimate, and thus succeed, if attention is given not only
   to adaptive capacity, but also to aspects of good governance. Through
   examples of the assertion of Indigenous rights, we illustrate critical

   relevant in the context of the Anthropocene by raising the complex
   two-way interplay between stone and society. Natural and built stone
   heritage is an asset that is vulnerable to present and future climate
   change. Especially in the context of built heritage, stone can also be
   conceptualized as a "large scale laboratory" in which the evolution of
   weathering, and thus past exposure conditions, can be studied (analogous
   to physical landscape studies). This concept of built heritage as a
   'recorder' of past environmental evolution is found from the very first
   moments of the development of Earth sciences as a formal discipline. The
   ideas reviewed and presented in the paper show how stone surfaces may be
   used to "read" background environmental changes, trends in pollution and
   even catastrophic events, such as fire. Stone surfaces teach us both
   about the past (since human interactions with stone began and they
   intensified through history) and about the nature of weathering.
   Understanding how past environmental changes have left a trace in stone
   allow us to use stone as a means to predict potential impacts of future
   change. Such understanding may be used to inform conservation management
   of our irreplaceable stone-built heritage assets, as well as to plan for
   future climate impacts on such assets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper presents the use of soil charcoal analyses in order to
   identify the origin of a Nardus stricta grassland in a mountain system
   (Mont Lozere, France), and the use of environmental resources and the
   construction of a cultural landscape. Two opposing theories have been
   proposed to explain the origin of this open landscape (1450-1700 m
   altitude): natural or anthropogenic. The identification and radiocarbon
   dates of charcoal fragments of Fagus sylvatica, which were found in all
   of the pits located in the current grassland area and dated to 3695-3633
   cal BC, demonstrate that this species has been present on the upper part
   of Mont Lozere since the Middle Neolithic. In addition, the presence of
   pioneer species (Betula, Salix, Corylus avellana), as well as mid-
   (Prunus cf avium) and late-successional species (F. sylvatica) supports
   the hypothesis that the grassland contained both pioneer and mature
   phases of forest landscapes. The C-14 dates, ranging from c. 4200 cal BC
   to 1200 cal AD, show that fire events occurred with different climatic
   influences. Fire events may correspond to one or several fires in a
   short period at the scale of the slope. Moreover, the dates coincide
   with the early and extensive human impact detected in the Massif Central
   and Mont Lozere. To explain the regular occurrences of fire events from
   the Middle Neolithic to the Central Middle Ages, agro-pastoral clearings
   have been postulated, as have been identified in other areas in the
   Pyrenees and in the Alps. Such human impact may have been magnified, or
   least facilitated, by climatic conditions. Comparison with additional
   data (pollen, archaeology, ecology) demonstrates that this grassland
   area is not natural and corresponds to an ancient forested system that
   has been used and transformed by societies since the Neolithic, although
   climate change may have certainly affected this transformation. The aim
   of this research is to promote this cultural heritage in collaboration
   with the National Park of the Cevennes in order to protect its future.

   some authors and non-native by others: these contrasting assessments can
   mislead the prioritization of management actions to preserve the species
   and the riparian vegetation that is its host. Based on a
   multidisciplinary approach, including palaeobotanical and ecological
   information, we assessed its status in Italy including the ecological
   and conservation value of the riparian plant communities hosting it in
   the Cilento National Park (S-Italy). Palaeobotanical data showed that P.
   orientalis in Italy should be considered an archaeophyte. According to
   the ecological assessment of the riparian plant communities hosting P.
   orientalis, the presence of the species can be interpreted as an
   indicator of an unfavourable state for the conservation of riparian
   vegetation. Knowing the status of a species remains one of the first
   steps to take to correctly propose scientifically based solutions for
   the conservation of plant diversity. However, there are no absolute
   criteria for conservation because all conservation objectives can be

   protected as a symbolic tree, an archaeophyte testifying an ancient

   to the development of conservation programs in high-diversity regions
   where indigenous communities maintain customary rights to their lands
   and seas. A major challenge that these programs face is the alignment of
   international conservation values with those of the indigenous
   communities whose cooperation and support are vital. International
   environmental organizations are focused on biodiversity conservation,
   but local communities often have a different range of concerns and
   interests, only some of which relate to biodiversity. One solution to
   this problem involves adoption of a cultural landscape approach as the
   ethical and organizational foundation of the conservation program. In
   our conservation work in coastal Melanesia, we have developed a cultural
   landscape approach that involves the construction of a conceptual model
   of environment that reflects the indigenous perceptions of landscape.
   This model incorporates cultural, ideational, and spiritual values
   alongside other ecosystem services and underpins the conservation
   activities, priorities, and organizational structure of our programs.
   This cultural landscape model was a reaction to a survey of
   environmental values conducted by our team in which Solomon Islanders
   reported far greater interest in conserving cultural heritage sites than
   any other ecosystem resources. This caused a radical rethinking of
   community-based conservation programs. The methodologies we adopted are
   derived from the fields of archaeology and historical anthropology, in
   which there is an established practice of working through research
   problems within the framework of indigenous concepts of, and
   relationship to, landscape. In our work in Isabel Province, Solomon
   Islands, coastal communities have enthusiastically adopted conservation
   programs that are based on cultural landscape models that recognize
   indigenous values. A particularly useful tool is the Cultural Heritage
   Module, which identifies cultural heritage sites that become targets of
   conservation management and that are used as part of a holistic
   framework for thinking about broader conservation values.</td>

   vulnerable to global warming, because of their isolation, narrow
   geographic distribution, and limited geographic range shifts. Stochastic
   and selective processes can act on the genome, modulating genetic
   structure and diversity. Fragmentation and historical processes also
   have a great influence on current genetic patterns, but the spatial and
   temporal contexts of these processes are poorly known. We aimed to
   evaluate the microevolutionary processes that may have taken place in
   Mediterranean high-mountain plants in response to changing historical
   environmental conditions.Methods: Genetic structure, diversity, and loci
   under selection were analyzed using AFLP markers in 17 populations
   distributed over the whole geographic range of Armeria caespitosa, an
   endemic plant that inhabits isolated mountains (Sierra de Guadarrama,
   Spain). Differences in altitude, geographic location, and climate
   conditions were considered in the analyses, because they may play an
   important role in selective and stochastic processes.Key Results:
   Bayesian clustering approaches identified nine genetic groups, although
   some discrepancies in assignment were found between alternative
   analyses. Spatially explicit analyses showed a weak relationship between
   genetic parameters and spatial or environmental distances. However, a
   large proportion of outlier loci were detected, and some outliers were
   related to environmental variables.Conclusions: A. caespitosa
   populations exhibit spatial patterns of genetic structure that cannot be
   explained by the isolation-by-distance model. Shifts along the altitude
   gradient in response to Pleistocene climatic oscillations and
   environmentally mediated selective forces might explain the resulting
   structure and genetic diversity values found.</td>

   species richness and composition patterns in temperate regions.
   Nonetheless, is poorly understood the extent to which these effects
   individually or in combination determine functional diversity, many
   studies have simply assumed equilibrium between current climate and
   functional diversity. We estimated functional richness (F-Rich) and
   dispersion (F-Disp) of North American broad-leaved trees by combining
   distribution and trait information. Then, we determined if contemporary
   water-energy availability, current topographic variability, historical
   climatic stability, and lagged immigration from glacial refugia
   co-determined the functional diversity of North American broad-leaved
   trees. We did this by assessing the directionality, magnitude, and
   relative importance of various contemporary and historical environmental
   factors know to affect species diversity. Contrasts were performed
   across all North America (Mexico, United States, and Canada), and areas
   within this region that were glaciated or ice-free during the Last
   Glacial Maximum (similar to 21 000 yr ago). F-Rich and F-Disp showed
   distinct geographic patterns that are strongly associated with both
   contemporary environmental conditions and glacial-interglacial climate
   change. Model averaged regression coefficients and AIC-based variable
   relative importance estimates show that contemporary productivity
   (F-Rich-w(AIC): 1.0; F-Disp-w(AIC): 1.0), annual precipitation
   (F-Rich-w(AIC): 0.81; F-Disp-w(AIC): 1.0), and accessibility to glacial
   refugia (F-Rich-w(AIC): 0.92; F-Disp-w(AIC): 1.0) have the strongest
   associations to FRich and FDisp. Furthermore, the association of
   functional diversity with topographic heterogeneity showed steeper
   slopes in ice-free regions. These findings suggest that, contrary to the
   expectation climate-diversity equilibrium, functional diversity of North
   America broad-leaved trees is codetermined by current climate and lagged
   immigration from glacial refugia.</td>

   Europe. It is based on a mass tourism model strongly modulated by
   seasonality and with high environmental costs. Main tourism stakeholders
   are currently implementing complementary activities to mitigate
   seasonality, regardless of climate change. But climate is-and will
   remain-a key resource or even a limitation for many types of tourism.
   Assessing the present conditions and exploring the future evolution of
   climate potential for these activities have become a priority in this
   area. To this end, the climate index for tourism (CIT)-originally
   designed to rate the climate resource of beach tourism-is adapted to
   specifically appraise cycling, cultural tourism, football, golf, motor
   boating, sailing and hiking. Climate resources are derived by using
   observed and projected daily meteorological data. Projections have been
   obtained from a suite of Regional Climate Models run under the A1B
   emissions scenario. To properly derive CITs at such local scale, we
   apply a statistical adjustment. Present climate potentials ratify the
   appropriateness of the Bay of Palma for satisfactorily practicing all
   the examined activities. However, optimal conditions are projected to
   degrade during the peak visitation period while improving in spring and
   autumn. That is, climate change could further exacerbate the present
   imbalance between the seasonal distributions of ideal climate potentials
   and high attendance levels. With this information at hand, policy makers
   and regional tourism stakeholders can respond more effectively to the
   great challenge of local adaptation to climate change.</td>

   method in practice. The ` values based' approach taken is suitable for a
   wide range of cultural heritage including landscapes, monuments, and

   is sufficiently flexible to account for localized concerns. The

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Landscape Atlas of Flanders describes the traditional relic
   landscapes in Flanders (Belgium), characterized by important heritage
   values and more specifically by natural-scientific, historical,
   sociocultural and aesthetic values. These heritage landscapes constitute
   a considerable part of the common cultural heritage and are therefore
   managed by specific landscape management plans. However, these plans do
   not address climate change vulnerability and adaptation, while this is
   considered as an important driving force of landscape change. This
   change may impact on the unaffected traditional character of heritage
   landscapes and cause these valuable landscapes to deteriorate. In this
   study, we assess and map the potential overall impact of climate change
   on two relic landscapes in Flanders and map possible adaptation measures
   on a detailed level to allow insertion in the landscape management
   plans. Detailed synthesis vulnerability and adaptation maps are
   elaborated in a GIS, based on the results of impact- and model studies.
   The vulnerability maps indicate that both case studies are sensitive to
   climate change. In particular, forest desiccation, wind throw, crop
   deterioration, soil erosion and flooding might affect the landscape
   quality and threaten the natural-scientific, historical and aesthetic
   heritage values of the landscapes. In order to preserve these heritage
   values, the adaptation maps present possible adaptation measures, which
   are sustainable and nondestructive with respect to the landscape
   quality. Although adaptation will cause change as well, it offers more

   predicted to be increased rain and snow, higher temperatures, increased
   wind loads, and sea-level rise. This will increase the number of floods
   and landslides, along with more cycles around the freezing point and
   increased exposure to high moisture. The main issue for protecting
   Norway's historical monuments from climate change is how to be aware of
   and how to handle the coming problems. One challenge is to define and
   give this information to heritage owners and local authorities. The
   purpose of this paper is to describe some of the practical threats
   related to climate change, and provide suggestions for mitigation and
   adaption strategies.Design/methodology/approach - Theoretical
   information of the problem is useful at a general level, but the
   practical impact has to be used at a local level. Improved knowledge
   about the risks for deterioration at different exposure levels, thorough
   surveys, and practical solutions, can significantly reduce the negative
   effects. This knowledge must reach the people that have local and daily
   contact with the cultural heritage. Information to the owners and
   responsible authorities about the normal risk of deterioration and how
   to identify risks related to climate change is crucial.Findings - The
   main results of the authors' work is a methodology dealing with the
   problem step-by-step production of a web-site based on fact sheets for
   heritage owners and managers. The fact sheets are divided amongst
   different subjects and are designed to be informative and easy to use
   for owners and responsible authorities.Originality/value - The results
   presented in this paper will increase the knowledge of how owners of
   cultural heritage can be prepared for climate change on a practical,
   hands-on level. This can, for example, be done by a brief overall
   analysis of the threats of the cultural heritage in a specific
   municipality. The analysis can be summarised in a list of increased
   possible risks, with direct practical information given to those needing
   it, and placed online. This would enable detection of and reaction to
   warning signs of an unusual situation. Information, training and
   production of both general and specific plans for action in case of
   extreme situations are also important in order to prevent the negative
   effects of climate change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper investigates the potential of airborne lidar for recording
   and monitoring erosion levels in environmentally fragile upland
   landscapes, using an area of the Brecon Beacons National Park as a case
   study. Upland areas contain a rich variety of natural and cultural
   resources that are increasingly endangered through factors such as
   insensitive land-use practices, improvements in recreational access and
   climate change. Airborne lidar provides a highly detailed record of
   microtopography, in this example at a resolution of 0.5 m with a
   vertical accuracy of c.0.15 m and the ability to differentiate elevation
   changes to within 1-2 cm. The technique therefore allows the rapid and
   cost-effective recording of the nature and extent of erosion at a
   landscape scale, with the results of this analysis recording over 46
   kilometres of path erosion within a 3.8 km(2) area. The technique also
   provides the ability to highlight particular areas of risk, such as
   extensive braided erosion around path intersections and damage to
   protected SSSI habitats, providing a snapshot record of erosion at a
   particular point in time and an invaluable source of information for
   conservationists and policy-makers. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Cultural Heritage (CH) is recognised as being of historical, social, and
   anthropological value and is considered as an enabler of sustainable
   development. As a result, it is included in the United Nations'
   Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 11 and 8. SDG 11.4 emphasises the
   protection and safeguarding of heritage, and SDG 8.9 aims to promote
   sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and
   products. This paper briefly reviews the geoinformatics technologies of
   photogrammetry, remote sensing, and spatial information science and
   their application to CH. Detailed aspects of CH-related SDGs, comprising
   protection and safeguarding, as well as the promotion of sustainable
   tourism are outlined. Contributions of geoinformatics technologies to
   each of these aspects are then identified and analysed. Case studies in
   both developing and developed countries, supported by funding directed
   at the UNSDGs, are presented to illustrate the challenges and
   opportunities of geoinformatics to enhance CH protection and to promote
   sustainable tourism. The potential and impact of geoinformatics for the
   measurement of official SDG indicators, as well as UNESCO's Culture for
   Development Indicators, are discussed. Based on analysis of the review
   and the presented case studies, it is concluded that the contribution of
   geoinformatics to the achievement of CH SDGs is necessary, significant
   and evident. Moreover, following the UNESCO initiative to introduce CH
   into the sustainable development agenda and related ICOMOS action plan,
   the concept of Sustainable Cultural Heritage is defined, reflecting the
   significance of CH to the United Nations' ambition to "transform our
   world". (C) 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of

   method is based on the analysis of the historic climate that is
   established in the European Standard EN 15757:2010. This new approach
   enables interpreting visible damage and assessing cause-effect
   relationships and it finds practical application in improving
   conservation strategies for real life buildings and objects. The paper
   investigates how it may be advantageous to reconstruct the historic
   climate back in time to obtain sound information about the target
   relative humidity (RH) level and the domain of RH fluctuations that can
   be considered safe for conservation. The method was applied to an inlaid
   wooden choir in the basilica of S. Giustina, Padua, Italy. The past
   indoor climate has been reconstructed over the whole life of the object,
   built in 1477, with documentary proxy data, instrumental readings and
   building simulation. Winter has been found to be the most critical
   season for the mechanical stress and wood yield. For the future, the
   indoor climate has been simulated until 2100 to timely devise preventive
   conservation measures to reduce the risk induced by climate change.
   Finally an evaluation of uncertainties has been considered. (c) 2015

   extent to which environmental issues are governable. Climate change
   projections highlight positive feedbacks between invasive species spread
   and increased bushfire risk. We use empirical evidence of current
   practices of invasive plant management, and the case of Gamba grass
   (Andropogon gayanus), to illustrate what it means to live with invasive
   plants. Gamba is a significant threat to tropical savanna biodiversity
   through its influence on fire regimes across northern Australia. We
   analyse the practices of Gamba governance via policy analysis,
   interviews with over 50 managers and participant observation. Our
   results show the multiple ways in which Gamba exceeds and escapes
   governance, exposing the impossibility and risks of absolute control as
   a management framing. By attending to practice in this way, we show how
   an alternative framing, in which living with weeds is a more explicit
   part of the governance framework, can work. Our framing contributes to
   more effective management because political choices are made more
   transparent, valorises pragmatic knowledge about the messy reality of
   living with weeds, and mobilises a broader range of resources including
   land managers now resistant to the state. The Gamba-fire assemblage has
   mobilised political action by invoking fire policy rather than weed
   policy, but not necessarily in a way consistent with best practice weed
   management. Attention to these practices of vernacular governance not
   only shows the ideal of present control to be illusory, but will also
   provide important cultural resources in the form of networks and
   capacity, as the challenges of invasive species shift and intensify. (C)

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The conservation of agricultural heritage is an emerging field that
   offers opportunities for integrating heritage values into strategies for
   environmental, economic and social sustainability in rural areas in the
   US. Even though farmsteads and ranches are iconic representations of
   rural communities, little attention has been given to the cultural
   heritage values of agricultural landscapes or in agricultural policy.
   Climate change, global market drivers and significant demographic shifts
   threaten agrarian resources. Today, there is an urgent need to address
   the loss of agricultural land and enhance the sustainability of
   agricultural systems. This article argues that it is timely to consider
   heritage as an integral part of developing strategies to adapt
   agricultural systems and make them more resilient. Some promising recent
   efforts demonstrate that heritage designations, partnerships and
   stewardship programmes offer strategic advantages and should be an
   integral part of a broader set of agricultural reforms, creating a new
   synthesis.</td>

   World-renown natural beauty and ongoing biological and geological

   Maintaining World Heritage values will necessitate the re-framing of
   values to integrate socioeconomic factors in management and reduce

   conservation planning that achieves social equity is urgently needed to
   rectify historical mistakes and update current management practices.
   Characterizing and sustaining biological refugia will be important to
   retain biodiversity in areas that are less visited. The development of a

   Marine Protected Area (MPA) of its kind (at the time of inception, the
   largest in the world) and includes eight low-lying islands, shallow
   coral reefs, submerged shallow and deep seamounts and extensive
   open-ocean and ocean floor habitat. Due to their isolation, the shallow
   reef habitats have been protected de facto from severe exploitation,
   though the surrounding waters have been continually fished for large
   pelagics and whales over many decades. PIPA was created under a
   partnership between the Government of Kiribati and the international
   non-governmental organizations-Conservation International and the New
   England Aquarium. PIPA has a unique conservation strategy as the first
   marine MPA to use a conservation contract mechanism with a corresponding
   Conservation Trust established to be both a sustainable financing
   mechanism and a check-and-balance to the oversight and maintenance of
   the MPA. As PIPA moves forward with its management objectives, it is
   well positioned to be a global model for large MPA design and
   implementation in similar contexts. The islands and shallow reefs have
   already shown benefits from protection, though the pending full closure
   of PIPA (and assessments thereof) will be critical for determining
   success of the MPA as a refuge for open-ocean pelagic and deep-sea
   marine life. As global ocean resources are continually being extracted
   to support a growing global population, PIPA's closure is both timely
   and of global significance.</td>

   cultural resources of coastal zones is growing worldwide. On the other
   hand, the range of threats to coastal zones increasingly posed by
   hydro-meteorological natural phenomena has led to a trend in the
   analysis and assessment of risks to these areas. The available
   literature dealing with coastal risk assessment is quite wide, focusing
   mainly on the risk evaluation of coastal flooding and erosion resulting
   directly from the occurrence of extreme natural events. The risk
   assessment methodologies are usually specific to the conditions and
   available data of each country, society or location, though most have
   evolved to assess the risk concept more precisely and rigorously.
   However, there are still very few studies that present feasible and
   effective methodologies, which lead to the effective integration of risk
   analysis at all levels. In Mexico coastal risk analysis has barely begun
   despite our extensive coastline, which is highly vulnerable to the
   threat of tropical cyclones. This paper aims to give a broad view of the
   risk assessment methodologies which already exist, in order to provide a
   starting point for future efforts in Mexico and elsewhere.</td>

   Climate Change (UNFCCC) is the stabilization of greenhouse gases at a
   level that would prevent dangerous interference with the climate system.
   Over the past decade, a growing body of scientific and anecdotal
   evidence has demonstrated that significant adverse effects of climate
   change are already occurring in the Arctic. In turn, Arctic climate
   impacts have fundamentally altered the Inuit's way of life, which is
   intimately tied to the physical environment. This article argues that
   changes to the Inuit's means of subsistence, property, cultural
   heritage, enjoyment of natural resources and movement, among others,
   constitute human rights violations. Those human rights violations, when
   combined with other global consequences of Arctic climate impacts,
   indicate that the Parties to the UNFCCC are not meeting their
   international legal obligations. As a consequence, the author submits
   that the Parties to the UNFCCC should re-examine their negotiating
   positions to determine what level of greenhouse gas stabilization will
   prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. In
   making that determination, human rights must be considered.</td>

   human populations degrade the environment, destroy the habitats of other
   species, decimate their populations, and progressively alter the global
   climate. Setting aside certain areas and protecting them is necessary.
   It is a vital emergency measure. Nevertheless, with the prospects of
   impending 'greenhouse' induced climatic changes, this may not be enough.
   A numerical simulation model of the global terrestrial biosphere and
   quantitative indices of site biological diversity are used to predict
   the response of potential vegetation to climatic perturbations and to
   estimate the changes in global biological diversity which may result.
   This study suggests that climate change is likely to put global
   biological diversity, in general, and biodiversity in temperate and
   boreal biomes, in particular, in peril. Moreover, geographically
   protected areas, such as World Heritage sites, are threatened as well.
   If conservation is to meet its mandate, if conservation is to actually
   preserve the variety of life, it cannot limit itself to protecting
   continents and water bodies. Conservation should also include less
   tangible resources such as the atmosphere and the global climate.From
   the standpoint of global biodiversity preservation, limiting the

   low-lying coastal areas of the Mediterranean, 37 are at risk from a
   100-year flood and 42 from coastal erosion, already today. Until 2100,
   flood risk may increase by 50% and erosion risk by 13% across the
   region, with considerably higher increases at individual WHS. Our
   results provide a first-order assessment of where adaptation is most
   urgently needed and can support policymakers in steering local-scale
   research to devise suitable adaptation strategies for each WHS.</td>

   However, whether historical dynamics in species distributions and

   most part, unknown. The geographic patterns of plant functional space
   size (richness) and packing (dispersion) for six widely distributed
   orders of European angiosperms were estimated using atlas distribution
   data and trait information. Then the relative importance of
   late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change and contemporary
   environmental factors (climate, productivity, and topography) as
   determinants of functional diversity of evaluated orders was assesed.
   Functional diversity patterns of all evaluated orders exhibited
   prominent glacial-interglacial climate change imprints, complementing
   the influence of contemporary environmental conditions. The importance
   of Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change factors was comparable
   to that of contemporary environmental factors across evaluated orders.
   Therefore, high long-term paleoclimate variability has imposed
   consistent supplementary constraints on functional diversity of multiple
   plant groups, a legacy that may permeate to ecosystem functioning and
   resilience. These findings suggest that strong near-future anthropogenic
   climate change may elicit long-term functional disequilibria in plant

   tolerable value of surface recession and corrosion. However, some
   problem related to air pollution persists. In particular, Random Forest
   Analysis (RFA), highlights PM10 as the main responsible for materials
   corrosion, in 2010. Two scenarios in 2030 have been tested, highlighting
   that the corrosion levels of limestone, copper and bronze exceed the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Future climate change is likely to pose significant challenges for
   heritage management, especially in landscape settings, such as river
   valleys as the magnitude, intensity and nature of geomorphological
   processes alter in response to changing threshold conditions. Industrial
   landscapes afford particular challenges for the heritage community, not
   only because the location of these historic remains is often intimately
   linked to the physical environment, but also because these landscapes
   can be heavily polluted by former ( industrial) processes and, if
   released, the legacy of contaminants trapped in floodplain soils and
   sediment scan exacerbate erosion and denudation. Responding to these
   challenges requires the development of methodologies that consider
   landscape change beyond individual sites and monuments and this paper
   reports the development of such an approach based on investigation of
   the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage Site, Derbyshire, UK.
   Information on geomorphological evolution of the Derwent Valley over the
   last 1000 years, a time period encompassing the last two periods of
   major climatic deterioration, the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice
   Age, has been dovetailed with archaeological and geochemical records to
   assess how the landscape has evolved to past landscape change. However,
   in addition to assessing past evolution, this methodology uses national
   climate change scenarios to predict future river change using the
   CAESAR-Lisflood model. Comparison of the results of this model to the
   spatial distribution of World Heritage Site assets highlights zones on
   the valley floor where pro-active mitigation might be required. The
   geomorphological and environmental science communities have long used
   predictive computer modelling to help understand and manage landscapes
   and this paper highlights an approach and area of research cross-over
   that would be beneficial for future heritage management. (C) 2015

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Critical Zone Science extends the definition of soils beyond the
   traditional pedogenetic processes. The critical zone, as the interface
   linking the lithosphere, the hydrosphere, the atmosphere and the
   biosphere matches well the concepts that have recently emerged,
   especially in Europe, in relation to the development of a new soil
   protection policy for the European Union. The European Union (EU) Soil
   Thematic Strategy, as presented by the European Commission in 2006,
   intends to address the protection of soil functions that go far beyond
   the limited definition of soils as the first 2-m of the surface
   structured in pedogenetic horizons. The seven functions that the EU
   wants to protect (biomass production, buffering and filtering of water,
   biodiversity pool, source of raw materials, support for housing and
   infrastructure, carbon sink and archive of cultural heritage) require
   considering soils in a much broader context. The full unconsolidated
   material from the surface to bedrock has to be included if we want to
   fully understand and manage the seven soil functions considered of
   policy relevance by the EU. Soil science needs to go beyond traditional
   pedological studies and enlarge its scope by including a full
   understanding of the critical zone. In this sense Critical Zone Science
   can be considered the perfect match with the emerging concepts of the EU
   Soil Thematic Strategy. Indeed this reflects the recent evolution from
   the historical relevance of soils science in the framework of a single
   soil function, namely agricultural production, toward a shift of the
   attention of the importance of soils also in other policy areas beyond
   agriculture, including the water policy, the climate change policy, the
   biodiversity policy, the energy resources policy, the cultural policy,
   etc. At global level, Critical Zone Science community can contribute to
   the Sustainable Development Goals recent debates. A new scientific
   paradigm for soil science is needed if we want to respond to these
   emerging needs from new soil related policy areas. This new paradigm is
   Critical Zone Science and is adequately responding to these new needs
   going far beyond the traditional agricultural view on soils. (C) 2015

   but in Britain it is our historic mining industry that has left a legacy
   of contamination in the landscape, around both the immediate mine sites
   as well as within the river valley floors that drain these orefields. It
   has been estimated that the levels of lead and zinc stored within some
   northern British river systems represent values comparable to
   present-day reserves of economically viable ore deposits and exposure to
   them can be detrimental to human health. Despite the prevalence and
   significance of these deposits, they have been neglected by the cultural

   as mine buildings, technologies of ore procurement and processing, and
   the final products of manufacture. This paper argues that in light of
   future climate change and legislation associated with the European Union
   Water Framework Directive, heritage managers and industrial
   archaeologists have to start investigating these deposits as part of
   their studies and to engage with the environmental science and
   geomorphological communities who are, at present, setting the agenda in

   non-pollen palynomorphs (NPPs), macroscopic charcoal, and Spheroidal
   Carbonaceous Particles (SCPs), 5000 years of landscape change, fire
   history and land-use have been reconstructed from Dune Pond, Santa
   Barbara County, California. The pond was sensitive to Holocene regional
   climatic variability, showing different phases of lower (4600-3700 cal
   yr BP, 2100-700 cal yr BP, historical period) and higher (3700-2100 cal
   yr BP, 700-150 cal yr BP) local moisture availability. During this
   period the landscape was dominated by a coastal mosaic vegetation
   including dune mats, coastal scrub and salt marshes on the dunes and
   backdunes, with chaparral and oak woodland growing in the valley plains
   and foothills. Fire was intimately linked with such dominating mosaic
   vegetation, and the combination of wet conditions and the presence of
   nearby human settlement were a trigger favoring coastal fires for at
   least two periods: from 3100 to 1500 cal yr BP and from 650 cal yr BP
   until the 18th century. In both cases fire was an important tool to keep
   an open coastal landscape attractive to hunting wildlife. Finally,
   matching this varied range of high-resolution paleoecological proxies
   with historical records we could characterize the development of
   colonial transported landscapes following the Euro-American settlement
   of Santa Barbara. The introduction of livestock grazing by Spanish
   colonists favored erosive processes and the introduction of fecal-borne
   parasites in freshwater bodies, negatively impacted salt and brackish
   coastal marshes, and promoted the invasion of alien grasses and
   ruderals. This agro-pastoral landscape was consolidated during the
   American period, with a greater role for cultivation, the development of
   industrial activities and increased population. Despite negative
   environmental consequences such as the loss of native habitats, exotic
   land-uses and plants introduced during the historical period
   significantly contributed to the configuration of a cultural landscape
   which forms part of the cultural heritage of California. (C) 2015

   cultural heritage and infrastructure. Effective adaptation requires a
   holistic approach that incorporates scientific knowledge together with
   local and traditional knowledge. Community-based adaptation built on
   local knowledge is of great value for environmental management,
   particularly when scientific data are lacking. This article reports a
   case study that integrated traditional and scientific knowledge using
   participatory three-dimensional modeling (P3DM) in BoeBoe village,
   Solomon Islands. P3DM is a process by which members of the local
   community build a physical terrain model and overlay it with the
   location of important resources such as protected areas or harvesting
   sites. Additionally, SLR inundation scenarios based on surveyed
   elevations were incorporated into a geographic information system (GIS),
   allowing for a real-time integration of science with local knowledge.
   Despite discrepancies in scales and accuracy, information from both the
   P3DM and GIS were complementary. The process, itself, provided a forum
   for discussion between many members of the village who would normally
   not be involved and highlighted the importance of community engagement
   when building capacity for adaptation to climate change.</td>

   greatly impacted by natural disasters. This study demonstrates the
   association between tourism economies and impacts of hurricanes in the
   southeastern United States containing coastal national parks, known for
   attracting a large number of tourists and having experienced hurricanes.
   In keeping with two longitudinal data methods (i.e. panel logit model
   and autoregressive integrated moving average), this study focused on the
   relationship between the (1) duration, intensity, and damage of
   hurricanes; (2) existing climate conditions; and (3) tourism demand on
   park visitation during hurricane and tourism seasons. As a whole, the
   impacts of hurricanes and climate conditions (precipitation,
   temperature) were found to have a negative effect on tourism demands
   (park visitation). With regard to the response of tourism economies to
   natural disaster damage, parks that experienced stronger natural
   disasters may be closed for a longer period in order to reconstruct
   facilities or natural/cultural resources damaged by storms. In an
   attempt to improve tourism-based regional economies, overcome the
   challenge of natural disasters on tourism economies, and increase
   opportunities for establishing disaster management, it is necessary to
   make an effort to allay unexpected damage to tourism-based areas through

   bacteria is a topic of increasing concern for coastal ecosystems,
   including the Chesapeake Bay. Surface water temperature trends in the
   Bay indicate a warming pattern of roughly 0.3-0.4 degrees C per decade
   over the past 30 years. It is unclear what impact future warming will
   have on pathogens currently found in the Bay, including Vibrio spp.
   Using historical environmental data, combined with three different
   statistical models of Vibrio vulnificus probability, we explore the
   relationship between environmental change and predicted Vibrio
   vulnificus presence in the upper Chesapeake Bay. We find that the
   predicted response of V. vulnificus probability to high temperatures in
   the Bay differs systematically between models of differing structure. As
   existing publicly available datasets are inadequate to determine which
   model structure is most appropriate, the impact of climatic change on
   the probability of V. vulnificus presence in the Chesapeake Bay remains
   uncertain. This result points to the challenge of characterizing climate
   sensitivity of ecological systems in which data are sparse and only
   statistical models of ecological sensitivity exist.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Relationships between landscape-scale geomorphology and aspects of the
   human environment (including heritage and material cultures) are best
   examined in landscapes with a strong geomorphological imprint of past
   climatic and environmental changes, and where human activity has been
   present for a long period of time. In Cornwall, southwest England, a
   strong geomorphological signature is imparted by weathering of granite
   bedrock under cold Quaternary climates, and a strong cultural and
   heritage imprint is manifested in material and nonmaterial ways through
   archaeology, art, literature and folklore, and is illustrated in this
   paper through examples of Bodmin Moor (north Cornwall) and West Penwith
   (west Cornwall). Landscapes of Bodmin Moor include wide valleys with
   underfit rivers and upland summits with prominent tors, resulting from
   granite weathering and slope processes during the Tertiary and
   Quaternary. Pollen records show how human activity has changed on the
   moor over time, with a peak of settlement during the Bronze Age, and
   expansion of grazing into the Iron Age. Daphne du Maurier's novels, set
   on or adjacent to Bodmin Moor, emphasize the moor's relationship to
   unstable and intense human emotions and crises. In West Penwith, which
   is geomorphological similar to Bodmin Moor, geomorphology culture
   relations are demonstrated in different ways but through a similar sense
   of place and regional identity. The St Ives School of early 20th Century
   art, including the local artist Peter Lanyon and the sculptor Barbara
   Hepworth, draws inspiration from the local land and seascapes. The oral
   traditions and folklore of Zennor emphasize the importance of witchcraft
   and superstition that are in part founded on the wildness of upland
   summits and stormy coastline. Across West Penwith, tin mining and the
   mining trade exerted a strong impact on regional socioeconomic and
   cultural development from the Bronze Age until the end of the 19th
   Century, seen through settlement patterns, scientific innovation and
   Nonconformism. Today these geomorphology culture relations are
   memorialized in the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape World
   Heritage Site. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.</td>

   "stigmatised" by historical environmental and military associations is
   of particular interest in contemporary debates about sustainable energy
   policy. Recent claims in the literature suggest that despite such
   stigmatisation, lay views on such technologies may be shifting towards a
   "reluctant acceptance," in the light of concerns about issues like
   anthropogenic climate change. In this paper, we report on research into
   learning and reasoning processes concerned with a largely unknown
   nuclear energy technology; namely fusion power. We focus on the role of
   the nuclear label, or "brand," in informing how lay citizens make sense
   of the nature of this technology. Our findings derive from a comparative
   analysis of data generated in Spain and Britain, using the same
   methodology.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Unprecedented rates of resource development and climate change at
   northern latitudes coupled with a lack of baseline information limits
   our ability to set ecologically meaningful criteria needed to protect
   these inherently sensitive ecosystems. We surveyed water and sediment
   chemistry, community composition of benthic algae and invertebrates and
   fish, and condition of a sentinel fish species, slimy sculpin (Cottus
   cognatus), in 2 rivers adjacent to metal mines and in 20 reference
   rivers in the headwaters of a World Heritage Site, the South Nahanni
   River Basin, NWT, Canada. The normal range (i.e., mean 2 standard
   deviations) of biological conditions in regional reference sites
   (grouped by community type) were used to set ecologically meaningful
   effect sizes. These effect sizes were used in noncentral hypotheses
   tests to assess the ecological condition of potentially impaired sites.
   Significant impairments at sites influenced by current and historical
   mining activity were indicative of mild enrichment (e.g., increased
   benthic abundance and sculpin condition) and bioaccumulation of metals
   (e.g., increased concentrations of Cu and Fe in muscle tissue of
   sculpin). Comparisons between our regional reference study and a
   concurrent upstream-downstream study showed that the sensitivity of
   biological endpoints was typically related to the impairment criteria
   used and not to the type of study design. Concentrations of metals such
   as Al, Cu, and Fe in river water at reference sites were above federal
   and regional guidelines, suggesting that these guidelines are not
   appropriate for the metal-rich headwaters of the South Nahanni River.
   The ephemerellid mayflies Drunella spinifera and Ephemerella, maculata
   were present in 4 of our study sites; their occurrence had not
   previously been documented in the Yukon or Northwest Territories. Our
   results confirmed that the lack of baseline information on the
   physiochemical and biological composition of northern rivers is
   hampering our ability to evaluate changes in these understudied
   ecosystems. However, the use of noncentral hypotheses tests based on
   empirically derived effect sizes enabled us to develop ecologically
   meaningful protection criteria, maintain statistical rigor and provide
   probabilities of impairment that can be used directly in risk
   assessment. Integr. Environ Assess Manag 2010;6:12-27. (C) 2009 SETAC</td>

   aside from the complexities of climate change itself. The Convention is
   not accustomed to addressing broad, interdisciplinary matters beyond
   World Heritage; it has not historically had strong links with other
   conventions outside UNESCO; it has relatively few resources; and climate
   change will result in escalating change, whereas the World Heritage
   Convention is based upon a presumption of relative stability and
   manageable change. Responding to climate change in the longer term will
   require a clear definition of the role of the World Heritage Convention

   amongst the most pristine of any cool-temperate oceanic island. However,
   Gough Island is relatively depauperate in indigenous invertebrates, and
   preliminary results of an ongoing terrestrial invertebrate survey have
   shown that introduced species now equal, or exceed, the numbers of
   indigenous species in many group,;, Furthermore many of these
   introductions are likely to have occurred within the last 50 years. Such
   high rates of recent introductions constitute a significant conservation
   threat to the indigenous invertebrates and the island's biodiversity as

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Aim: Species that respond favourably to environmental change tend to be
   mobile or dispersive. Living within trees has some benefits over life on
   the ground. Species that move vertically within forest canopies can take
   advantage of increased complexity and resource availability, which
   should correspond to increased resilience to environmental variability
   and change. Here we show that two modes of movement, arboreality and
   horizontal dispersal, across an entire bioregional vertebrate fauna in
   the rain forests of Australia are associated with measures of historical
   environmental stability.Location: Wet Tropics, Queensland,
   Australia.Time period: Historical (c. 20,000 years ago) and current
   (1990-2009).Major taxa studied: Mammal, bird, reptile, and frog
   species.Methods: We analysed vertebrate distribution for 195 species and
   trait data from 20 years of standardized sampling. We derived an
   arboreality index (i.e., the extent of vertical habitat used by each
   species) from a large database of field observations combined with
   expert opinion scores on arboreality. We compared community-wide trends
   in arboreality and their horizontal dispersal potential with historical
   climate since the Last Glacial Maximum (c. 20,000 years ago) and current
   climate over 20 years of the recent past (1990-2009).Results: Vertical
   (arboreality) and horizontal (dispersal) movement were positively
   correlated, and both were negatively correlated with environmental
   stability. We found that arboreal species dominate communities in
   historically unstable areas, and these areas have both low richness and
   low endemism. Further, we show that low-and high-altitude arboreal
   species experience similar thermal regimes, whereas low-and
   high-altitude ground-dwelling species experience little overlap in
   thermal regimes.Main conclusion: Higher variability and overlap in
   temperature among rain forest canopies suggests less geographical
   separation in tolerable conditions for arboreal taxa when compared with
   ground-dwelling taxa. Increased ecological plasticity in horizontal and
   vertical movement as well as exposure and pre-selection to high
   temperature variability appears to allow arboreal species to exploit
   climatically uncertain areas, a capacity that may serve them well in
   responding to future climate change.</td>

   Russia. Regionally, these forests are differentiated into spruce, pine
   or birch dominance due to climatic differences. Variation in tree
   species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a
   combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including
   both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency,
   as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of
   their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain
   forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more
   productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or
   latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often
   referred to as "Europe's last wilderness", even if human influence of
   varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because
   of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of
   paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of
   ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values. As such, they also
   provide unique reference areas for basic and applied research, and for
   developing methods of forest conservation, restoration and
   ecosystem-based management for the entire Fennoscandia. However, the
   current rapid change in climate is predicted to profoundly affect the
   ecology and dynamics of these forests in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Decades of archaeological research in southeastern Arabia (Oman and the
   UAE) have provided a good understanding of the evolution of human
   societies in this arid region, with the transition from mobile
   pastoralism to settled agricultural villages occurring at the start of
   the Hafit period (ca. 3100-2700 BCE). The delayed adoption of farming,
   ceramics, mudbrick architecture, metallurgy, and other technologies
   until the start of the 3rd millennium BCE has been a particularly
   salient feature of this region relative to its neighbours in
   Mesopotamia, southern Iran, and northwestern South Asia. However, recent
   geo-archaeological research at the World Heritage Site of Bat, situated
   within the Wadi Sharsah valley in northwest Oman, has provided evidence
   of irrigation practices that have been dated to the early-mid 4th
   millennium BCE. While direct evidence of farming from this early period
   remains elusive, the presence of irrigated fields at this time raises
   new questions about the supposedly mobile pastoralist groups of the
   Arabian Neolithic and the beginning of farming practices in the region.

   effects of hazards or generating additional risk. Investigation is
   required to understand climate change-related risks for all components
   of human systems, including cultural heritage. Accordingly, this paper
   aims to present a new risk assessment index for cultural heritage,
   referred to as the Cultural Heritage Risk Index (CHRI). The paper
   applies a desk-based review of the existing literature on climate
   change-related risks for cultural heritage and of multi-level policy and
   planning documents of cultural heritage management in Australia. The
   paper then presents the CHRI and describes its attributes based upon the
   formalisation of risk as a function of hazard, exposure and
   vulnerability. CHRI is applied to a unique asset of cultural heritage in
   Newcastle (Australia), the Burwood Beach Wastewater Treatment Works
   (BBWTW). The paper shows that this asset has a moderate risk related to
   climate change, and that some interventions can be applied to decrease
   its vulnerability. The use of a new index such as CHRI allows creating a
   baseline for the exploration of the relations between climate
   change-related risks and cultural heritage. It can be an effective part
   of tools assessing climate change-related risk on cultural heritage in
   Australia and might aid in prioritising specific interventions. (C) 2016

   essential for devising appropriate conservation measures mitigating the
   ongoing degradation of coral reef habitats. Based on a gridded
   distribution database and phylogenetic information, we compared the
   phylogenetic structure of assemblages for three tropical reef fish
   families (Labridae: wrasses, Pomacentridae: damselfishes and
   Chaetodontidae: butterflyfishes) using the net relatedness (NRI) and
   nearest taxon (NTI) indices. We then related these indices to
   contemporary and historical environmental conditions of coral reefs
   using spatial regression analyses. Higher levels of phylogenetic
   clustering were found for fish assemblages in the Indo-Australian
   Archipelago (IAA), and more particularly when considering the NTI index.
   The phylogenetic structure of the Pomacentridae, and to a lower extent
   of the Chaeotodontidae and Labridae, was primarily associated with the
   location of refugia during the Quaternary period. Phylogenetic
   clustering in the IAA may partly result from vicariance events
   associated with coral reef fragmentation during the glacial periods of
   the Quaternary. Variation in the patterns among fish families further
   suggest that dispersal abilities may have interacted with past habitat
   availability in shaping the phylogenetic structure of tropical reef fish
   assemblages.</td>

   Quaternary have elicited long-term disequilibria between species
   diversity and environment. Despite its importance for ecosystem
   functioning, the importance of historical environmental conditions as
   determinants of FD (functional diversity) remains largely unstudied. We
   quantified the geographic distributions of plant FD (richness and
   dispersion) across Europe using distribution and functional trait
   information for 2702 plant species. We then compared the importance of
   historical and contemporary factors to determine the relevance of past
   conditions as predictors of current plant FD in Europe. For this, we
   compared the strength of the relationships between FD with temperature
   and precipitation stability since the LGM (Last Glacial Maximum),
   accessibility to LGM refugia, and contemporary environmental conditions
   (climate, productivity, soil, topography, and land use). Functional
   richness and dispersion exhibited geographic patterns with strong
   associations to the environmental history of the region. The effect size
   of accessibility to LGM refugia and climate stability since the LGM was
   comparable to that of the contemporary predictors. Both functional
   richness and dispersion increased with temperature stability since the
   LGM and accessibility to LGM refugia. Functional richness' geographic
   pattern was primarily associated with accessibility to LGM refugia
   growing degree-days, land use heterogeneity, diversity of soil types,
   and absolute minimum winter temperature. Functional dispersion's
   geographic pattern was primarily associated with accessibility to LGM
   refugia growing degree-days and absolute minimum winter temperature. The
   high explained variance and model support of historical predictors are
   consistent with the idea that long-term variability in environmental
   conditions supplements contemporary factors in shaping FD patterns at
   continental scales. Given the importance of FD for ecosystem
   functioning, future climate change may elicit not just short-term shifts
   in ecosystem functioning, but also long-term functional disequilibria.</td>

   economic activity in island nations, particularly in tropical regions.
   However, most of the tropical islands face similar constraints, viz.,
   threat to natural resources, chances of biopiracy, impact of climate
   change, population pressure and unsystematic tourist management.
   Ecotourism, as a concept, envisages promoting tourism with due regard to
   natural environment and ecological sanctity of the destination.
   Archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar (A&amp;N) Islands is one of picturesque
   geographical creation in the Bay of Bengal, India, in tropical region
   and is an emerging tourist destination. It was observed that around 2.2
   lakhs national and international tourists visit the A&amp;N Islands
   annually. With tourism sector as an integral component, the service
   sector with share of 56% in gross state domestic product dominates the
   island economy. An analysis based on primary survey from various
   stakeholders associated with the sector revealed that factors such as
   economy in travel and boarding, availability of tourist facilities and
   comfort, safety, etc. were major factors that determined the choice of
   the tourists that visited the islands. The weights given by the tourists
   to the natural sites in A&amp;N Islands revealed that the landscape topped
   list with 91.6% score by the visitors followed by beaches (91.3%),
   scenery (86.5%), reserved forests (84.6%), limestone caves (66.3%) and
   coral sights (65.8%). Coral sites were given weight of 65.8% of
   tourists, cultural and historical tourism products 85.4% for the natural
   history. Similarly, historical sites (83.7%), museums (78.6%) and
   heritage sites (72.8%) were also among top cites attraction. Recent
   initiatives by the Andaman administration gives due to care to
   sustainably develop the tourism infrastructure of the islands to harness
   the potential of eco-friendly tourism in this picturesque tourist haven.</td>

   migration are all concerns for the ecological risk of wetland
   landscapes. Indices of landscape-scale ecological risks have the
   potential to influence changes in landscape patterns, the conditions of
   endangered plants and animals, and influences from nature and humans.
   Semi-variation function and gravity center models were used to quantify
   risk area changes. The changes of landscape ecological risk were
   analyzed for Bayanbulak Wetland from 2000 to 2010. In addition to
   landscape and species distribution data, GIS technology and remote
   sensing were used in this study. Results show that landscape structure
   changed over the 10-year period, with high-cover grassland area
   decreasing the most. Landscape pattern index types also changed for the
   study area. The number of landscape-type patches to low-cover grassland
   decreased, the landscape fragmentation index of dry land and high-cover
   grassland was reduced, and the interference degree of middle-cover
   grassland increased over the study period. The index of landscape
   ecological risk decreased from 2000 to 2010, with the spatial structure
   changing from a single center concentration to a multi-center
   distribution. All varying ecological risk regions of gravity centers
   moved from the northeast to the southwest. The gravity migration of the
   Level 2 region moved the furthest. Additionally, evidence suggests that
   various threatening factors reduce the ecological function and systems
   of wetlands. These include climate change, biological invasion, human
   activities, and water pollution. This paper assesses the heritage site
   landscape ecological risk and calculates the gravity center change of
   the region, which can be formulated to enrich and develop the research
   of small- and medium-sized wetlands in cold, semi-arid climates.</td>

   management plans to include an assessment of the possible impact of
   climate change on the heritage site, and to include mitigation
   strategies as appropriate. This paper focuses on progress in the UK
   towards developing and implementing climate-change adaptation policies
   within these plans. Research undertaken to examine this complex area of
   work has identified key challenges faced by site managers when including
   and subsequently implementing climate-change policies. Information was
   collected through a questionnaire survey of all UK World Heritage Sites,
   reviews of relevant documents, and in-depth interviews with a wide range
   of professionals. The study found that plans are gradually being updated
   to include climate-change considerations, however, this is not always
   straightforward and plan implementation is proving challenging. Concerns
   about data reliability and the contested nature of scientific data on
   climate change are widespread, and there is a perceived lack of the
   necessary information to make fully informed decisions. Resource
   constraints, a need for more specialist skills and guidance, and
   differing levels of interest and motivation in the issue are other
   challenges.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>It is generally accepted that the natural habitats of most pest insects
   can be found outside the synanthropic environment in layers of leaf
   litter, under bark, as well as in rodent or bird nests. Indeed, most of
   the common pests have been reported as being facultative nidicolous.
   Therefore infestation of commodities by pest insects out of these
   reservoirs is one considerable possibility. However, the likelihood of a
   pest's occurrence and survival out-doors largely depends on its
   ecological potential and competitiveness against other species of the
   same ecological guild. Some pest species are rarely found in wild
   habitats, especially in those regions where they are not native and
   where they have been introduced by man. The fabric pest Tineola
   bisselliella serves as a good example. Most likely originating in
   Central or Southern Africa this insect was introduced into Europe
   probably not earlier than the late 18(th) century. Being more tolerant
   to dry environments than other fabric pests its economical importance
   increased during the 20(th) century when in-door climates changed
   because of central heating systems. Its occurrence in out-door natural
   habitats must be regarded as accidental. Reported founds of webbing
   clothes moth larvae in bird nests e.g. have been largely overstated in
   the literature. T bisselliella should be regarded as an eusynanthropic
   species.</td>

   of the most well-preserved and continuous records of human habitation on
   the North American continent. Geoarchaeological investigations in the
   midcontinent of North America have revealed spatial and temporal
   patterns of sedimentation that control regional and local visibility,
   preservation, and distribution of archaeological deposits in colluvial
   slope and alluvial fan settings. Regional colluvial slope and alluvial
   fan sedimentation began ca. 8,500 yr B.P. Two major fan and slope
   building episodes are represented in most areas: 8500-6500 and 6000-2000
   yr B.P. Within each of the major aggradation episodes, sedimentation was
   episodic, with shorter intervening periods of reduced sedimentation and
   soil formation. Late Holocene shifting of feeder stream trenches removed
   earlier apex and mid-fan fan sediments, formed a complex series of
   cut-and-fill fan-trench sequences, and deposited a series of coalescing
   distal fan lobes. Archaeological deposits older than approximately 8500
   yr B.P. pre-date aggradation of Holocene alluvial fans and colluvial
   slopes and are not found in these landforms, while archaeological
   deposits younger than 2000 yr B.P. are shallowly buried on colluvial
   slopes and alluvial fans except in filled fan-head trenches and distal
   fan lobes. The challenge for interpreting and managing cultural
   resources in alluvial fan and colluvial slope settings is to properly
   evaluate how geologic processes have modified cultural patterns and
   affected the visibility of the archaeological record. (C) 2003 Wiley

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Hundreds of thousands of significant archaeological and cultural
   heritage sites (cultural sites) along the coasts of every continent are
   threatened by sea level rise, and many will be destroyed. This wealth of
   artefacts and monuments testifies to human history, cosmology and
   identity. While cultural sites are especially important to local and
   Indigenous communities, a stall in coordinated global action means
   adaptation at a local scale is often unsupported. In response, this
   paper produces a practical climate change risk analysis methodology
   designed for independent, community-scale management of cultural sites.
   It builds on existing methods that prioritise sites most at risk from
   climate impacts, proposing a field survey that integrates an assessment
   of the relative cultural value of sites with assessment of exposure and
   sensitivity to climate impacts. The field survey also stands as a
   monitoring program and complements an assessment of organisational
   adaptive capacity. The preliminary field survey was tested by Indigenous
   land managers in remote northern Australia at midden and rock art sites
   threatened by sea level rise, extreme flood events and a range of
   non-climactic hazards. A participatory action research
   methodology-incorporating planning workshops, semi-structured interviews
   and participant observations-gave rise to significant modifications to
   the preliminary field survey as well as management prioritisation of 120
   sites. The field survey is anticipated to have global application,
   particularly among marginalised and remote Indigenous communities.
   Well-planned and informed participation, with community control,
   monitoring and well-informed actions, will contribute significantly to
   coordinated global and regional adaptation strategies.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The magpie goose is an iconic tropical species highly valued as a
   conservation asset and by Aboriginal people as a cultural resource. Most
   of the global population occurs in the Kakadu Region of northern
   Australia, which is at high risk from the combined impacts of invasive
   species and future sea-level rise. Future management responses require
   an increased understanding of their spatial and temporal dynamics and
   customary value. Historical aerial-survey data of geese and their nests
   in the Kakadu Region (1981-2006, 25 years) were used to characterise
   seasonal use of floodplains. Habitat hotspots' co-occurred with high
   abundance of plants that provide nesting material in the wet season and
   food in the dry season, particularly the bulbs of Eleocharis dulcis
   sedge. Goose numbers across the Northern Territory (1958-2000, n=42
   years) exhibited 20-year decadal trends coupled with similar trends in
   rainfall and stream flow (1954-2006), which in turn were influenced
   strongly by global-scale interactions between the El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Stream flow drives the
   spatial and temporal dynamics of magpie geese at regional and decadal
   scales through its direct influence on floodplain-vegetation dynamics.
   Customary harvesting practices of geese and their eggs ascertained from
   interviews (2011-2014) showed that their cultural value extends beyond
   consumption, highlighting the need to address socio-ecological contexts
   in future management responses.</td>

   Understanding the barriers that can impede preservation is of paramount
   importance, as is developing solutions that facilitate the planning and
   management of vulnerable cultural resources. Using online survey
   research, we elicited the opinions of diverse experts across
   southeastern United States, a region with cultural resources that are
   particularly vulnerable to flooding and erosion from storms and sea
   level rise. We asked experts to identify the greatest challenges facing
   cultural heritage policy and practice from coastal climate change
   threats, and to identify strategies and information needs to overcome
   those challenges. Using content analysis, we identified institutional,
   technical and financial barriers and needs. Findings revealed that the
   most salient barriers included the lack of processes and preservation
   guidelines for planning and implementing climate adaptation actions, as
   well as inadequate funding and limited knowledge about the intersection
   of climate change and cultural heritage. Experts perceived that
   principal needs to overcome identified barriers included increased
   research on climate adaptation strategies and impacts to cultural
   heritage characteristics from adaptation, as well as collaboration among
   diverse multi-level actors. This study can be used to set cultural
   heritage policy and research agendas at local, state, regional and
   national scales.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Arctic and northern coastal regions are among the least developed in the
   world in terms of density of settlements, population and resource
   exploitation. It is often assumed that these regions will be frontiers
   of future change, conflict and opportunity due to climate change, new
   transportation routes, geopolitical tensions and increasing demands for
   their natural resources. But to what degree do global discourses about
   future challenges in northern coastal areas align with the perceptions
   and concerns of people living there? Identifying the mainstream public
   concepts of change can be essential for developing effective and
   legitimate policies for coastal regions. We surveyed a representative
   sample of residents in the Lofoten Vesteralen archipelago in Northern
   Norway to identify their perceptions of the main conflict issues and
   drivers of change facing their region. Petroleum exploration,
   infrastructure development, the fishing industry, and uncertainty about
   future municipal governance and public services emerged as the key
   conflict themes. Perceptions of drivers group in positive forces;
   developments and improvements in transportation, the fishing industry,
   tourism, new marine industries and cultural heritage protection, as well
   as negative factors; climate change, aging and declining rural
   populations, degrading of the cultural landscape due to reduced grazing,
   and bureaucratic obstacles in the fishing industry. The main attention
   is on social and economic drivers of change, as well as "doorstep"
   concerns rather than global discourses. National or global environmental
   and geopolitical issues are largely absent in the responses. (c) 2017

   life-sustaining resources, but are also subject to devastating losses
   from floods. To work toward reducing these losses, this paper aims to
   (a) synthesize understanding on the elements that make flood risk
   management challenging in high mountain areas and (b) identify practices
   that can be applied in reducing the exposure and vulnerability of
   mountain communities. Through a review of the literature and case
   studies, we identified the flood-related challenges associated with
   complex topography and hydrogeology, insufficient data and
   infrastructure, weakly defined governance structures, and sensitivity to
   climatic and landscape changes. We examined five practices needed for
   reducing flood risk in these vulnerable areas, involving (1) the
   acquisition and effective dissemination of information about floods, (2)
   basin-scale hazard assessment and disaster response planning, (3)
   clearly defining governance responsibilities and distributing them
   across multiple jurisdictional layers, (4) implementing effective and
   diverse mitigation measures, and (5) training and engaging local
   residents and officials in flood risk reduction. Considerations and
   needs for implementing these practices in mountain areas are discussed,
   highlighting the commitment of resources needed for distributed
   governance, effective planning, land use and building regulations, and
   engagement of the public.</td>

   Sagarmatha National Park, a United Nations Educational, Scientific, and
   Cultural Organization World Heritage Site in the Himalayas of eastern
   Nepal, were evaluated using multitemporal satellite imagery in
   combination with land use data and sociological information gathered
   from semistructured interviews and workshops. We asked study
   participants about LULC changes, the causes of each change, and the
   likely duration of its effects, and used this information to produce
   high-resolution maps of local perceptions of LULC change. Satellite
   image analysis revealed that above 6000 m there has been a decrease in
   the area covered by snow and ice and a consequent expansion of glacial
   lakes and areas covered by rock and soil. Between 3000 and 6000 m,
   forest and farmland are decreasing, and areas under grazing, settlement,
   and shrubland are increasing. Such LULC changes within the protected
   area clearly indicate the prevailing danger of land degradation. Results
   from the interviews and workshops suggest that people tended to detect
   LULC change that was acute and direct, but were less aware of slower
   changes that could be identified by satellite imagery analysis. Most
   study participants said that land use changes were a result of rapid
   economic development and the consequent pressure on natural resources,
   especially in the tourism industry and especially below 6000 m
   elevation, as well as limitations to protected area management and a
   period of civil war. Human influence coupled with climate change may
   explain the changes at higher elevations, whereas anthropogenic
   activities are solely responsible in lower areas. Although global
   factors cannot be mitigated locally, many of the local drivers of LULC
   change could be addressed with improved management practices that aid
   local conservation and development in this high mountain ecosystem. A
   broader interdisciplinary approach to LULC change should include a mix
   of satellite image analysis and local observations.</td>

   for the Jade Bay (German Wadden Sea) over the last 4 decades (1970s to
   2009). Four presence-absence modelling algorithms (RF, MARS, GLM, GBM)
   were merged within the ensemble forecasting platform 'biomod2'. The
   present spatial distribution (representing 2009) was modelled based on
   statistical relationships between species presences, true species
   absences and 7 high-resolution (5 m) environmental grids. The past
   spatial distribution (representing the 1970s) was then hindcast in
   response to climate change-induced (1) sea-level rise, (2) water
   temperature increase and (3) seagrass recovery due to de-eutrophication.
   The past distribution scenario was evaluated using independent
   historical macrofauna data from the 1970s. Present ensemble prediction
   maps accurately captured the potential ecological niches of the modelled
   species throughout Jade Bay (i.e. good to excellent true skill statistic
   [TSS] and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]
   evaluation measures). The predicted present macrofauna distribution
   correlated most significantly with hydrodynamic conditions (submergence
   time, shear stress) and sediment characteristics (mud content). The past
   distribution scenario revealed significant changes in small-scale
   spatial distribution patterns of the characteristic modelled species
   (1970s to 2009) and showed a very good match with historical macrofauna
   data. Climate change-induced sea-level rise and its local implications
   for Jade Bay (changes in topo graphy, tidal range and submergence time),
   and water temperature increase explained the potential macrofauna
   distribution shifts over the last 4 decades.</td>

   the equiibrium moisture content of materials. Repeated RH cycling leads
   to mechanical failure and may endanger an object's structural integrity.
   Preventive conservation is based on adopting measures that will prevent
   fracture. Real-time interferometry allows the acquisition of sequential
   high-resolution full-field surface images from hygroscopic materials
   used in cultural heritage by recording during cycles of changing RH. The
   differential images allow the development of a preventive methodology
   directly through surface responses. Indications of the natural onset of
   degradation can be followed and traced before visible damage occurs,
   allowing preventive measures to be taken in advance. An ongoing study
   (Climate for Culture European project (FP7-ENV-2008-1 CfC no. 226973))
   aims to experimentally classify structural deterioration as a function
   of acclimatization and confirm the hypothesis that surface responses
   before deformation can indicate deformation threshold values as
   reference points for the onset of RH-induced deterioration.</td>

   charcoal particle stratigraphies from sediment cores from two sites,
   along with historical records, we reconstructed paleoenvironmental
   change in mid-coastal California. The San Antonio Creek section contains
   a discontinuous, Holocene-length record, while Mod Pond includes a
   continuous late Holocene record. Together the records allow for
   interpretation of most of the present interglacial. The longer record
   documents coastal sage scrub and chaparral dominated by woodland
   elements early in the Holocene to about 9000 yr ago, a potential decline
   in woodland communities with drying conditions during the middle
   Holocene to about 4800 yr ago, and an expansion of coastal sage scrub
   with grassland during the late Holocene. Evidence for climatic
   fluctuations during the last 1000 yr at Mod Pond is equivocal,
   suggesting that the Medieval Climate Anomaly-Little Ice Age had modest
   impact on the Mod Pond environment. However, evidence of significant
   environmental change associated with cultural transitions in the
   18th-19th centuries is stark. Introduction of non-native plants,
   establishment of cattle and sheep grazing, missionization of the native
   population, changes in burning practices during the Spanish period and
   enhanced cropping activities during North American settlement worked
   together to substantially modify the mid-California coastal landscape in
   about a century's time. (C) 2014 University of Washington. Published by

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Korea, China, Japan and Canada are all members of the Montreal Process
   (MP). However, there has been little comparative research on the public
   awareness of forest values within the framework of Sustainable Forest
   Management, not only between Asia and Canada, but also among these three
   Asian countries. This is true of aesthetic values, especially as the MP
   framework has no indicator for aesthetic values. We conducted surveys to
   identify similarities and differences in the perceptions of various
   forest values, including aesthetic values, between residents of the four
   countries: university student groups in Korea, China, Japan and Canada,
   as well as a more detailed assessment of the attitudes of Koreans by
   including two additional groups, Korean office workers, and Koreans
   living in Canada. A multivariate analysis of variance test across the
   four university student groups revealed significant differences in the
   rating of six forest functions out of 31. However the same test across
   the three Korean groups indicated no significant differences indicating
   higher confidence in the generalizability of our university student
   comparisons. For the forest aesthetic values, an analysis of variance
   test showed no significant differences across all groups. The forest
   aesthetic value was rated 6.95 to 7.98 (out of 10.0) depending on the
   group and rated relatively highly among ten social values across all the
   groups. Thurstone scale rankings and relative distances of six major
   forest values indicated that climate change control was ranked as the
   highest priority and scenic beauty was ranked the lowest by all the
   groups. Comparison tests of the frequencies of preferred major forest
   values revealed no significant differences across the groups with the
   exception of the Japanese group. These results suggest that public
   awareness of aesthetic and other forest values are not clearly
   correlated with the cultural backgrounds of the individuals, and the
   Korean university students' awareness could potentially be
   representative of the Koreans general public's opinion. We expect this
   research to contribute to the development of aesthetic and social
   indicators, and to the enhancement of balancing social with
   environmental and economic values within the SFM framework. (C) 2014

   climate adaptation strategies to reduce climate risk for cultural
   heritage. Cultural heritage has an important role in human well-being.
   This paper posits that cultural heritage requires an approach that
   recognises the uniqueness of cultural heritage. The paper draws from the
   United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR)
   Making My City Resilient campaign and the Heart of the City Partnership
   in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, and proposes a Cultural Heritage Adaptation
   Forum. The role of the forum is to develop adaptation strategies in a
   sustainable development context. This is an original attempt to link
   cultural heritage to climate risk.Design/methodology/approach - The
   paper draws from two initiatives and uses good practice established from
   the disaster management and climate communities and proposes a Cultural
   Heritage Adaptation Forum that can be used to formulate adaptation
   interventions for cultural heritage. The approach builds on active
   participation in a global overview of cultural heritage and climate risk
   led by UNISDR together with personal experience of implementing such
   strategies in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK.Findings - The paper finds that a
   model can be developed that incorporates good practice from the climate
   and disaster management communities.Practical implications - The paper
   presents a model that can be used by those stakeholders that have an
   interest in protecting cultural heritage form climate driven
   hazards.Social implications - Cultural heritage has a value for all and
   protecting it from climate driven hazards can impact human
   well-beingOriginality/value - The paper brings together concepts from
   different academic and practitioner communities. The concept outlined in
   the paper will be of interest to all those interested in protecting
   cultural heritage for climate driven hazards.</td>

   of the United States. However, coastal development, overfishing and
   climate change are threatening this industry and way of life. This study
   examines the perspectives of oyster harvesters and merchants in
   Brunswick County, North Carolina, USA to explore their capacity to adapt
   to these changing conditions. Using in-person, semi-structured
   interviews researchers collected information from seventeen
   interviewees, generating qualitative data that were analyzed using
   MAXQDA software. From the data collected several themes emerged
   revealing mixed sentiments on the impacts of climate change but a
   widespread sense that development and regulations threaten livelihoods
   and cultural heritage. This social-ecological system (SES), created
   through centuries of regulation, is experiencing rapid population growth
   with concurrent coastal development; it also includes oyster industry
   workers who have limited voice in decision-making but are affected by
   the political ecology of the region. Deliberately including oyster
   harvesters and merchants when formulating and implementing policy can
   help to strengthen the adaptive capacity of this SES while sustaining
   Brunswick County's coastal heritage. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In view of increasing threat of climate change, extreme whether
   conditions, and recent financial crisis there has been a concern for
   augmenting agriculture and food supply to growing population,
   particularly to the rural areas. Fortunately the communities living near
   biodiversity rich areas depend on wide variety of plant resources for
   their survival; selected species have high potential for food supply in
   near future. In this study, we investigated a multi-ethnic area in North
   east India, a global hotspot, where communities show high dependence on
   wild plant resources for their sustenance. We addressed the issues of
   diversity of food plants being collected from wild habitats and their
   prospect as new food items, broad nutritive values of selected edible
   wild plants, and suggested some guiding policy concerns for management
   of these valuable resources. The investigation was done during 2006 to
   2011; a total of 289 plants species were recorded used by selected
   tribal communities for diverse needs; 75 plant species used for their
   fruits, 65 as vegetables, 18 as mushrooms, 163 as medicinal plants, 13
   as spices, and 11 species for making local drinks and beverages. Use of
   an algae Prasiola crispa as vegetable was found confined to Monpa and
   Sherdukpens only. Nearly 76 species were traded in markets involving a
   good annual turnover. Most promising medicinal plant species of the area
   comprised Aconitum fletcherianum G.Taylor, Clerodendrum colebrookianum
   Walp., Swertia chirayita H.Karst., Cordyceps sinensis (Berk.) Sacc.,
   Picrorhiza kurrooa Royle, Dendrobium nobile Lindl., and Artemisia
   nilagirica (C.B.Clarke) Pamp. that were harvested on commercial shale
   for selling in national and international markets. More species were
   used at higher altitudes showing greater dependence on wild plant
   resources. Nutritive values of 16 most preferred edible species revealed
   that they comprised considerable proximate and macro-nutrients; some are
   well comparable with commercial fruits and crops in their nutritional
   quality. It is found the wild edible species play an important role in
   dietary nutritional balance, and access to these wild plant resources
   ensures communities to overcome uncertain food stocks particularly
   during adverse and extreme weather conditions. The study highlights the
   need to protect these plants in their wild habitats; selected species be
   domesticated by developing cultivation protocols. It is also emphasized
   that wild edible plants is an ignored facet of food supply, however if
   properly planned it can facilitate to develop multifunctional
   agricultural policies for securing food production along with sustaining
   landscapes, biodiversity and cultural heritage in rural areas at any
   part of the globe.</td>

   Identification of environmental correlates between species richness and
   climate factors is essential to understand the main drivers of richness
   distribution and species potentially vulnerable to climate change.
   Deserts allow testing influences of climatic factors on biodiversity
   distribution given that anthropogenic habitat change is usually reduced.
   This study combines reptile presence data (1 x 1 km scale) with
   environmental factors to derive distribution models for individual
   species and richness. Relationships are tested in a coastal desert area
   of the Atlantic Sahara in Mauritania that covers a UNESCO World Heritage
   Site and National Park. Five environmental clusters were identified and
   two reptiles exhibited strong selection for the cluster of smallest
   area. Maximum entropy modelling identified one climatic and two
   habitat-related factors (temperature, sandy and bare areas) as main
   predictors of species occurrence. Consistent negative relationships
   observed between temperature and species distributions suggest that
   global warming may affect reptile richness. Despite lack of information
   on species abilities to face climate change, 14 reptile species should
   be targeted for population monitoring. Hotspots of reptile richness were
   identified within the Parc National du Banc d'Arguin but also in
   unprotected areas currently subjected to increasing human activities.

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Common lands are known for the management problems they experience as
   well for their unique contributions to local communities cultural
   heritage. Forest knowledge and management of the commons represents a
   relevant component of this heritage that is being progressively lost
   when critical management problems are not solved. Sustainable
   development actions that, through participatory processes, involve the
   community in strategy design and implementation, offer a great
   opportunity to preserve commons cultural heritage and take best
   advantage of available knowledge. ForEnCarb is a pilot project financed
   by the Sustainable Development Service of Sardinia's regional
   administration, with scientific support of Sassari University. The
   project goal is to promote sustainable development of Seneghe, a local
   community of inner Sardinia, by effectively implementing provisions of
   the international agreements to combat climate change through forest
   planning programs.Most of Seneghe's forest area is in common land. For
   countless generations its residents have been entitled to collect wood,
   to hunt and to graze their cattle and sheep on these lands. In support
   of a process towards sustainable forest management, our study focused on
   the social and cultural heritage of the local community and the
   historical development of its territorial identity, with specific
   reference to forest-related knowledge. The paper presents the first
   results of an analysis of forest service archive documents and town
   council deliberations found in municipal and state archives. The sources
   used include the documentation from the 19th and 20th centuries, but
   enlighten only fragments of history since a large number of potentially
   useful documents have been lost or destroyed. Results include a time
   series analysis of allowances for cattle access, wood withdrawal and
   occurrence of forest fires. We conclude that woodlands subject to common
   rights carry a high symbolic value for this community, but social
   sensitivity concerning forest management practices, while necessary, is
   not sufficient to encourage sustainable practices. Integration in
   sustainable development processes, such as this climate change
   mitigation project, offers hope to reverse such a cultural decline. (C)

   any action. The suggested mitigation action against erosion depends on
   urbanization level, beach width, as well as cross-shore and long-shore

   temperature rise will require profound cultural transformations. Yet our
   knowledge of how to promote and bring about such deep transformative
   changes in the minds and behaviours of individuals and societies is
   still limited. As climate change unravels and the planet becomes
   increasingly connected, societies will need to articulate a shared
   purpose that is both engaging and respectful of cultural diversity.
   Thus, there is a growing need to 'raise the temperature' of integration
   between multiple ways of knowing climate change. We have reviewed a
   range of literatures and synthesized them in order to draw out the
   perceived role of the arts in fostering climate transformations. Our
   analysis of climate-related art projects and initiatives shows increased
   engagement in recent years, particularly with the narrative, visual and
   performing arts. The arts are moving beyond raising awareness and
   entering the terrain of interdisciplinarity and knowledge co-creation.
   We conclude that climate-arts can contribute positively in fostering the

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Current scientific evidence shows that humans colonized South America at
   least 15,000 years ago, but there are still many unknown aspects of this
   process, including the major and minor migratory routes involved, and
   the pattern of successive occupation of a diverse continental mosaic of
   ecosystems. In this context, the role of the Andean highlands (&gt;= 3400
   meters above sea level) has been neglected, because of the supposedly
   harsh conditions for humans including hypoxia and cold climate.
   Nevertheless, the environmental and cultural resources available in the
   high Andes constitutes an important "megapatch" that should be assessed
   in terms of human settlement patterns. We review the evidence for late
   Pleistocene/early Holocene hunter-gatherer occupation of one part of
   this megapatch, the northern Chilean Dry Puna, in its palaeoecological
   context. We focus on lithic technology, faunal remains, radiocarbon
   dates, and other archaeological materials related to different social
   activities, which allow us to suggest that groups of hunter-gatherers
   organized and adapted their way of life to highland ecosystems through
   logistical mobility, and curatorial strategies for lithic tool kits that
   included projectile points and other formalized tools. The morphology
   and technological processes involved are recognized over vast
   territories along the high Andes. We identify this material expression
   as the high south central Andean Archaic hunter-gatherer tradition,
   which also featured long distance mobile settlement systems and
   communication processes over this broad and distinct megapatch. More
   speculatively, we outline the hypothesis that these highland ecosystems
   constituted a suitable migratory route that may have been key for the
   early peopling of the continent, and contrast it with the alternative
   hypothesis of the initially secondary and seasonally intermittent
   exploitation of this habitat by hunter-gatherers dispersing along the
   Pacific coastal corridor. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Endangered snow leopard Panthera uncia is a flagship species of
   mountainous Asia and a conservation priority. China is the most
   important country for the species' conservation because it has the most
   potential habitat and the largest population of snow leopards.
   North-west Yunnan province in south-west China is at the edge of the
   snow leopard's range, and a biodiversity hotspot, where three major
   Asian rivers, the Yangtze, Mekong and Salween, flow off the Tibetan
   plateau and cut deep valleys through the Hengduan Mountains. The snow
   leopard's status in north-west Yunnan is uncertain. We conducted
   interviews and camera-trapping surveys to assess the species' status at
   multiple sites: two east of the Yangtze River and two between the
   Yangtze and Mekong Rivers. Thirty-eight herders/nature reserve officials
   interviewed claimed that snow leopards were present, but in 6,300
   camera-trap days we did not obtain any photographs of snow leopards, so
   if the species is present, it is rare. However, we obtained many
   photographs of potential prey, such as blue sheep Pseudois nayaur, as
   well as photographs of common leopards Panthera pardus, at high
   elevations (3,000-4,500 m). More study is necessary in Yunnan and other
   areas of south-west China to investigate the status and resource overlap
   of snow leopards and common leopards, especially as climate change is
   resulting in increases in common leopard habitat and decreases in snow
   leopard habitat.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>During the summer of 2010/2011, a regional marine heat wave resulted in
   coral bleaching of variable severity along much of the western coastline
   of Australia. At Ningaloo Reef, a 300 km long fringing reef system and
   World Heritage site, highly contrasting coral bleaching was observed
   between two morphologically distinct nearshore reef communities located
   on either side of the Ningaloo Peninsula: Tantabiddi (approximate to 20%
   bleaching) and Bundegi (approximate to 90% bleaching). For this study,
   we collected coral cores (Porites sp.) from Tantabiddi and Bundegi reef
   sites to assess the response of the Sr/Ca temperature proxy and Mg/Ca
   ratios to the variable levels of thermal stress imposed at these two
   sites during the 2010/2011 warming event. We found that there was an
   anomalous increase in Sr/Ca and decrease in Mg/Ca ratios in the Bundegi
   record that was coincident with the timing of severe coral bleaching at
   the site, while no significant changes were observed in the Tantabiddi
   record. We show that the change in the relationship of Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca
   ratios with temperature at Bundegi during the 2010/2011 event reflects
   changes in related coral vital processes during periods of environmental
   stress. These changes were found to be consistent with a reduction in
   active transport of Ca2+ to the site of calcification leading to a
   reduction in calcification rates and reduced Rayleigh fractionation of
   incorporated trace elements.Plain Language Summary In this paper, we
   compare coral-core geochemical records (Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) from two reef
   sites at Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia, which showed highly
   contrasting coral bleaching severities following a regional heat wave
   during the summer of 2010/11. We show that anomalous increases in Sr/Ca
   ratios and decreases in Mg/Ca ratios can provide a distinct signature of
   past thermal stress events making core records useful for understanding
   the variable impacts of regional ocean warming events within reef
   ecosystems. Furthermore, by using a novel approach we were able to
   explain the formation of these anomalies during periods of thermal
   stress through changes in coral physiological and kinetic processes,
   which, along with temperature, also effect the incorporation of trace
   elements in coral skeleton. This is of particular importance as coral
   core records are heavily relied upon for the understanding of climate
   change, yet the mechanisms responsible for acute changes in coral trace
   element ratios during periods of thermal stress have previously not been
   discussed. We thus hope our work will contribute to the understanding of
   coral physiology and the development of more robust records of climate
   change in the future.</td>

   simply, Modeler), an automated module of a knowledge-based urban
   planning support system, was developed to support the strategic
   technology implementation of environmentally friendly local energy
   planning. Modeler was developed as a tool that integrates various
   formats of the planning data into a unified format during the planning
   stage. It automates the three-dimensional (3D) modeling of the
   integrated urban space and presents visual information to support
   decision making processes. The system architecture of Modeler includes
   the formation of building polygons, textures for classified land cover
   shape, topography, and 3D urban space. Modeler was developed on a
   native-based software (S/W) platform. It was created with a single
   document frame (SDF) from the Windows Microsoft Foundadon Class (MFC)
   Library and is driven by a 3D-based engine that can be used by a GIS
   client. Modeler was validated for a domestic city in the urban planning
   stage on a test bed platform. Because of the expansion of a ubiquitous
   environment and increasing social network services (SNS), the ability to
   port the Modeler to a web-based platform should be investigated, thus
   enabling easier access for decision makers. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   taken on climate change as the subject matter of their work. Encouraged
   by activists (most notably Bill McKibben), artists have appropriated
   climate change as a social problem and decided that they too, alongside
   journalists, scientists, and activists, were called upon to engage with
   this issue. Dozens of noteworthy exhibitions, most notably in Boulder
   (2007), London and Copenhagen (2009), Paris (2012), New York (2013),
   Boston (2014), and Melbourne (2015), have placed climate change art on
   the map as a new and timely genre, displaying relevant artworks both
   alongside climate negotiations and in dedicated gallery spaces such as
   the Barbican in London. I argue that much progress has been made in
   appropriating climate change art as an essentially artistic, rather than
   propagandistic or activist practice. Although caught in the net of many
   criticisms, climate change art plays a crucial role in allowing the
   public to rethink the role of human beings' everyday activities in
   irrevocably altering the climate system. In effect, climate change art
   makes the Anthropocene a cultural reality. However, the review points
   out a strong artistic trend toward the imagery of apocalyptic sublime,
   which results in art that may be poignant, but falls out of step with
   the self-professed motivations of artists and curators alike. WIREs Clim

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Background: Large areas of heathland landscapes in Galicia, north-west
   Spain, have traditionally been extensively grazed by free-ranging cattle
   and wild ponies. Recently, a large reduction in the number of these
   larger herbivores has been observed, with unknown consequences for the
   habitat.Aims: To evaluate the effects of grazing and herbivore density
   on plant diversity, community composition and vegetation structure of
   the endemic wet heathlands dominated by Erica mackayana in
   Galicia.Methods: Field sampling of vascular plants, generalised linear
   models (GLMs), non-metric multidimensional distance scaling
   (NMDS).Results: Grazed sites had significantly higher total and rare
   species richness and diversity than ungrazed sites. Higher densities of
   cattle resulted in lower numbers of rare species, while wild pony
   density had no effect on rare species richness. In grazed sites,
   vegetation was lower with greater variation in height, resulting in
   greater heterogeneity of the habitat. Precipitation and summer
   temperatures were related to plant diversity, mainly beta diversity.
   Soil organic matter negatively correlated with rare species.Discussion:
   Grazing, mostly by wild ponies, was demonstrated to be positively
   related to plant diversity and vegetation structure. Lack of grazing or
   high cattle densities resulted in a negative effect on total and rare
   species richness and diversity. Future climate change may negatively
   affect heathland plant diversity. Galician wild ponies represent a
   unique case of sustainable management of a wild species and an
   invaluable cultural heritage. Moreover, they have a significant role in
   maintaining the endemic E. mackayana heathlands, what would justify
   specific conservation actions for these large herbivores.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Purpose - The theme of sustainability in museums has not been
   sufficiently explored in the international literature on cultural
   heritage management as well as few museums are already involved in
   programs to promote sustainable development. Considering this gap, the
   purpose of this study is twofold. Firstly, to provide a conceptual model
   applying the principles of sustainable development to the enhancement of
   cultural heritage and, secondly, to analyze the case of Marche
   Region.Design - After analysing the three dimensions of sustainability -
   environmental, social and economic - and their possible application to
   museum management, the research tested the theoretical assumptions
   through an exploratory qualitative/quantitative survey.Methodology - The
   structured questionnaire was submitted to a sample of museums and
   consisted of a wide range of questions, primarily, although not
   exclusively, quantitative, which examined both museum management and
   sustainability orientation.Approach - The analysis focused on two
   different dimensions: the first aimed at understanding the perception of
   sustainability and the value of its components, the second aimed at
   investigating museums' willingness and reasons to engage in concrete
   sustainability-oriented actions.Finding - The field research showed
   Marche Region's museums have a full awareness of the benefits of
   sustainable management. However, the lack of a managerial approach to
   the museums' development compromises their ability to transfer this
   orientation in operational policies.Originality of research - The paper
   provides a multidimensional model for measuring the level of museum
   sustainability, able to analyze cultural and behavioral components. This
   analysis identifies possible areas of intervention for regional policies
   aimed at improving sustainability orientation of museums.</td>

   consume terrestrially derived wood. Changes in environmental variables
   may result in shipworms spreading into the Baltic Sea - which would have
   devastating consequences for maritime cultural heritage and submerged
   wooden structures. We investigated the distribution and abundance of the
   shipworms Teredo navalis and Psiloteredo megotara along the Swedish
   coast in 2006-2008, and compared our findings with data collected at
   partly the same locations in 1971-1973. Wooden test panels were
   submerged in near-surface waters at 18 harbours. The presence of
   shipworms was determined by X-ray radiography of each panel. Sea surface
   temperature and salinity data were analysed to investigate whether any
   changes in distribution were correlated to changes in environmental
   variables. We found that past and present distributions of T. navalis
   were similar - indicating that no range expansion of shipworms into the
   Baltic Sea has taken place the last 35 years. The abundance of T.
   navalis was similar between decades at all investigated sites except two
   (Arild and Barsebackshamn), where abundances were higher in 2006-2008.
   The abundance of T. navalis varied along the coast and was positively
   correlated to mean sea surface salinity, but not to mean sea surface
   temperature (2006-2008 data). The distribution and abundance of P.
   megotara were similar during the two study periods with only single
   observations at a few sites. In conclusion, we found no evidence of
   range expansion of shipworms along the Swedish coast.</td>

   consist of multiple generations defined by periods of stability and
   reactivation. Where earlier phases of aeolian activity are masked by
   subsequent deposition, continuous high-resolution (200 MHz)
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images are used to reconstruct their
   dynamic history. Subsurface profiles from younger segments of the Great
   Dune Ridge massif along the northern Curonian Spit, Lithuania reveal
   several phases of dune migration, which generally correspond to climatic
   deterioration during the Little Ice Age. Exacerbated by regional
   deforestation, 15-30-m-high dunes have invaded coastal settlements,
   causing their repeated relocation. Along the study transect, an optical
   age of the younger slipface strata is consistent with the record of
   village entombment by drifting sand by AD 1797. This study demonstrates
   that in the absence of mappable paleosols, a combination of geophysical,
   luminescence-dating, and documentary databases offers a means of
   reconstructing the history of human-landscape interaction, with

   Asia-Pacific region will be forced to migrate from their homelands due
   to the negative impacts of climate change. While many representations of
   Pacific Island communities affected by climate change emphasize
   helplessness, Pacific Islanders have been negotiating identities of
   empowerment and resilience in both political and cultural arenas. This
   essay provides an analysis of the messages that Islander performers have
   chosen to convey through three performance contexts: the 2.011 Water Is
   Rising concert tour, which featured groups from Kiribati, Tokelau, and
   Tuvalu; 350 Pacific's Pacific Warrior Campaign, including both the 2013
   Warrior Day of Action and the 2014 Canoe Building Day of Action; and the
   multimedia dramatic performance Moana: The Rising of the Sea, written
   and produced by Vilsoni Hereniko. Through these three campaigns, we can
   see that Islanders are actively shaping their identity in the face of
   climate change, choosing to be seen not as victims in a far and rising
   sea but rather as a sea of warriors with the power to rise up, work
   together, and make their voices heard in order to save the lands and
   cultures that they cherish.</td>

   first glance, this seems reasonable, given the range of more concrete
   challenges people face in the context of climate change. However, the
   protection of cultural heritage is an important goal in its own right,
   even against the backdrop of other seemingly more pressing tasks. A
   human-rights-based approach to the debate on cultural heritage and
   climate change, it is argued, reinforces the international community's
   obligations to take necessary mitigation activities. Cultural rights and
   the corresponding duties, especially those under Article 15(1)(a) of the
   International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, have the
   potential to provide an effective additional normative basis for the

   map of zones representing the various seabed morphology zones. The
   Hannibal bank is an elongated, triangular guyot (flat topped seamount),
   which ranges in depth from 53m to 416m, covers an area of 76km(2) and is
   14.4km long and 7.1km wide. Hannibal bank is composed of steep slopes,
   more gentle slopes, top of the seamount, crests (elevated ridges at the
   top of the pinnacles), rugose areas (on crests, top of seamount and
   slope), gullies and pinnacles. The bank is asymmetric in nature with the
   Northerly side having a relatively gentle slope with gullies across the
   surface compared to the SouthWest side which is far steeper and more
   rugose. There are two pinnacles to the North and South East of the bank
   that range in depth from 180 to 333m. Rocky substrate makes up 22.6km(2)
   of the bank and sediment 37.8km(2). The bank and its steeply sided,
   rugose areas and pinnacles provide upright structures which can disrupt
   and topographically enhance currents, increasing productivity. The
   rugose areas of Hannibal Bank should be primary targets for further
   research efforts as they may contain corals and their rugosity indicates
   that these should be some of the highest faunal diversity areas of the
   bank. Hannibal Bank is likely to come increasing pressure in the future
   through climate change and fishing and this study has produced valuable
   information to assist in the future mapping and management of habitats,
   associated species and fisheries.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>When attempting to address the environmental problems of a catchment, it
   is important to consider changes in a long-term environmental context.
   However, the long-term data on the state of the environment that are
   required for such an examination are rarely documented. Such data
   collection typically requires several years of investigation and
   observation. In addition, as there may be a significant time lag between
   the occurrence of a phenomenon and its cause, subsequent environmental
   investigations of changing animal and plant states scaling up to 5 years
   may be inadequate. We conducted a long-term analysis of the
   environmental changes in five sub-catchments of the Nagara River, Japan,
   assessing a period of 30 years, using a questionnaire survey approach
   involving local communities. Four sub-catchments of the Yoshida River
   were also analyzed for comparison. In addition, we attempted to clarify
   the relationship between various environmental factors and the
   space-time response of animals and plants. The survey included eight
   topics: assumed information, hydrological characteristics, habitat
   conditions for living things, forest state, land cover conditions, river
   awareness, free-entry information, and respondent information. Our
   method also has academic significance in that it validates the
   environmental agent extraction technique using a questionnaire survey.
   Our results identify management strategies for minimizing biodiversity
   loss due to climate change. Forest management and human activities
   should be undertaken with care, and the environmental context going
   forward into the next century should be considered for integrated
   catchment management. Elsewhere, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, a
   much expanded network of protected areas, and/or efforts to provide
   corridors to ease species movements may be necessary at the global
   level. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

   reformulated due to the new energy efficiency requirements put forward.
   On both a national and an international level, energy efficiency
   measures are considered key actions within sustainability work,
   answering to the global issue of climate change. What does this imply
   for our built heritage? Contemporary conservation is characterized by
   the concept of sustainability, and integrated conservation is also
   expected to be sustainable. It is inherent in this tradition, but how
   are we going to balance the historic and architectural values with the
   new energy requirements? A research project, Energy Efficiency in Our
   Cultural Heritage (EEPOCH), consisting of a multiple case study, has
   been carried out over three years, studying selected objects restored
   within the Halland Model, a project over a decade long. In EEPOCH the
   multiple units of analysis are energy efficiency, historic and
   architectural values, management, and legislation. All are applied to
   the selected objects. The results and conclusions drawn from the
   analysis show that there are actions that are possible to take and to
   recommend, including national inventories of historic values in the
   existing building stock as well as guidance for the management of
   historic values on a municipal level for continued sustainable

   the aim of this contribution is to provide a comprehensive overview of
   the National Geoparks of China by reviewing the geological heritage and
   their intrinsic linkages with geological and climatic controls. A
   regional comparison of the widespread elastic and karst Geopark
   landforms indicates that the development of these terrains can only be
   understood within a synthesis of tectonic constraints, climatic changes
   and lithological properties, whereas the variety of types, forms, scales

   species-rich dry grasslands across European mountain regions and
   threatens conservation efforts in this vegetation type. To support
   national conservation strategies, we used a site-selection algorithm
   (MARXAN) to find optimum sets of floristic regions (reporting units)
   that contain grasslands of high conservation priority. We sought optimum
   sets that would accommodate 136 important dry-grassland species and that
   would minimize forest regeneration and costs of management needed to
   forestall predicted forest regeneration. We did not consider other
   conservation elements of dry grasslands, such as animal species
   richness, cultural heritage, and changes due to climate change. Optimal
   sets that included 95-100% of the dry grassland species encompassed an
   average of 56-59 floristic regions (standard deviation, SD 5). This is
   about 15% of approximately 400 floristic regions that contain
   dry-grassland sites and translates to 4800-5300 ha of dry grassland out
   of a total of approximately 23,000 ha for the entire study area.
   Projected costs to manage the grasslands in these optimum sets ranged
   from CHF (Swiss francs) 5.2 to 6.0 million/year. This is only 15-20% of
   the current total estimated cost of approximately CHF30-45 million/year
   required if all dry grasslands were to be protected. The grasslands of
   the optimal sets may be viewed as core sites in a national conservation
   strategy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In Central Italy, the "Valle Umbra" (remnant of the south-eastern arm of
   the plio-pleistocenic Tiberino basin) is a wide depression characterized
   by a very low declivity causing difficult drainage. During three
   millennia the zone became alternately partially or totally flooded, with
   lakes, swamps, and marshland, or sometimes quite dry and easily
   accessible and exploitable by man. The variation Was Caused by: a)
   climate changes, with rainfall increase or decrease; b) tectonic
   movements tending to rise or to lower the outflow threshold; c) Man who
   attempted to lower the outflow threshold and canalize streams and creeks
   for land reclaiming.From the first millennium BC, the Umbrians,
   Etruscans, Romans, Goths, Byzantines, Longobards, and Franks lived at
   different times in this valley, and left traces in various places
   depending on the environment.Front the 7th to the 3rd Century BC, traces
   of Etruscan and Roman settlements have been found on the surrounding
   hills or on slightly raised ground (Mevania). It is probable that the
   lowlands were swampy and so not easy to traverse. In the 3rd Century BC
   a huge Like is documented (Lacus Umber) which covered a great part of
   the valley bottom, where there were also numerous meandering screams.On
   the plain (at Aisillo) the ruins of a Roman temple have recently been
   discovered which was in use from the 2nd Century BC to the 3rd Century
   AD. This corresponds to the period of Roman domination. There is also
   much evidence of human dwellings in the plain which was easily
   accessible in Roman times. In 220 BC the most important road which
   crossed the zone (the Via Flaminia) was built. Traces of a Roman
   centuriation, for agricultural purposes, but also carried out in order
   to drain the swamps, have been discovered. We know that the valley was
   well organized, with plenty of well channelled water Courses. In Bevagna
   a Roman mosaic testifies to a thermal establishment here. A river (the
   Clitumnus) was navigable as far as the Tiber and Rome, and there were
   some river ports near the towns. In this healthy environment there were
   several villas and temples alongside the river some of which are still
   preserved.The Aisillo temple is now covered by about 2 meters of marshy,
   clayey and peaty sediments indicating that from the 4th Century AD
   onwards the valley plain became an impassable swamp. This is also
   confirmed by signs of a climatic deterioration with increased rainfall
   and decreasing temperatures, which lasted right up to the Middle Ages.
   Close to the end of the 5th Century AD Teodoricus reclaimed part of the
   Valle Umbra but during the subsequent Longobard invasion, lack of
   maintenance caused the valley to become a swamp once again.Later history
   is characterized by various attempts at reclamations attempts made by
   different municipalities, but lacking coordination. These often led to
   disputes and Fights between neighbouring communities since they
   sometimes caused damage to the land nearby. In conclusion, in each
   period it is possible to trace the influence of the environment on
   inha-bired areas and on the activities of the local populations. An
   historical reconstruction can provide the foundation for our knowledge
   of the territory and if properly used can help to develop knowledge of
   our cultural heritage and thereby the development of tourism.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The energy performance of heritage buildings is attracting growing
   interest in research and practice. Accordingly, as shown by our
   literature review, increasing numbers of articles on energy-efficiency
   measures for heritage buildings are being published in peer-reviewed
   journals. However, there is no overview of how energy efficiency and
   heritage conservation have been approached in the studies. To address
   this gap we categorized and assessed the identified studies in terms of
   two key elements of such investigations: energy analysis and analysis of
   cultural heritage values. Most of the studies evaluate and propose
   measures to reduce the operational energy use of single heritage
   buildings, and fewer have applied a broader system perspective.
   Moreover, the underlying notion of the buildings' cultural heritage
   values seems to have been derived mainly from international conventions
   and agreements, while potentially significant architectural, cultural
   and historical factors have been rarely discussed. Our findings
   highlight that, when considering energy improvements, cultural heritage
   values should be more explicitly articulated and analysed in relation to
   established conservation principles or methodologies. Besides further
   scientific study, this point to the need of designing best-practice
   approaches that allow transparency and knowledge sharing about the
   complex relationships between energy efficiency and heritage
   conservation of buildings.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Land degradation through environmental pollution represents a serious
   threat to vulnerable populations in rural China. To better understand
   farmers' perceptions of land degradation and their corresponding
   adaptation behaviour, this paper presents a theoretical framework to
   explain the interactions among awareness, perception, mitigation, and
   adaptation, and tests the framework using a case-study. A case-study was
   conducted in Qinghai, where historical environmental pollution from a
   chemical plant had caused the contamination of soil, groundwater, and
   river water, which had negatively impacted the livelihood of local
   farmers. A questionnaire survey was conducted (n=277), and the results
   were used to test the theoretical framework using structural equation
   modelling. Results indicated strong structural relationships between
   awareness and perceptions (r=.75, p&lt;.01), a relatively strong
   relationship between mitigation and adaptation (r=.63, p=.02), and a
   weak relationship between perception and mitigation (r=.20, p=.54). The
   study results suggested that farmers were well aware of land degradation
   issues, but they lacked in-depth knowledge about the situation and about
   sophisticated adaptation methods; therefore, they had chosen the easiest
   adaptation strategy- to avoid the degraded land. The farmers were less
   willing to bear significant financial costs in adaptation; however, the
   proportion of respondents adopting moving' as an adaptation strategy was
   relatively high, suggesting that farmland degradation in combination
   with employment opportunities in urban areas may be causing
   environmental displacement and accelerating urbanization. The authors of
   this paper recommend that policymakers should consider more than just
   technical factors in addressing China's environmental pollution and land
   degradation problems. The socio-economic status of farmers should be a
   critical component in the equation, and bottom-up empowerment adaptation
   behaviour should be used in combination with top-down mitigation.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Aim: Range expansions facilitated by humans or in response to local
   biotic or abiotic stressors provide the opportunity for species to
   occupy novel environments. Classifying the status of newly expanded
   populations can be difficult, particularly when the timing and nature of
   the range expansion are unclear. Should native species in new habitats
   be considered invasive pests or actively conserved? Here, we present an
   analytical framework applied to an Australian marsupial, the sugar
   glider (Petaurus breviceps), a species that preys upon on an endangered
   parrot in Tasmania, and whose provenance was uncertain.Location:
   Tasmania, Australia.Methods: We conducted an extensive search of
   historical records for sugar glider occurrences in Tasmania. Source
   material included museum collection data, early European expedition
   logs, community observation records, and peer-reviewed and grey
   literature. To determine the provenance of the Tasmanian population, we
   sequenced two mitochondrial genes and one nuclear gene in Tasmanian
   animals (n=27) and in individuals across the species' native range. We
   then estimated divergence times between Tasmania and southern Australian
   populations using phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses.Results: We found
   no historical evidence of sugar gliders occurring in Tasmania prior to
   1835. All Tasmanian individuals (n=27) were genetically identical at the
   three genes surveyed here with those individuals being 0.125% divergent
   from individuals from a population in Victoria. Bayesian analysis of
   divergence between Tasmanian individuals and southern Australian
   individuals suggested a recent introduction of sugar gliders into
   Tasmania from southern Australia.Main conclusions: Molecular and
   historical data demonstrate that Tasmanian sugar gliders are a recent,
   post-European, anthropogenic introduction from mainland Victoria. This
   result has implications for the management of the species in relation to
   their impact on an endangered parrot. The analytical framework outlined
   here can assist environmental managers with the complex task of
   assessing the status of recently expanded or introduced native species.</td>

   the temperate forest and steppe biomes, which provides important
   habitats for many endangered species and represents an important hotspot
   of biodiversity. Although the number of studies on forest-grassland
   mosaics is increasing, information currently available about the general
   compositional and structural patterns of Eurasian forest-steppes is
   scarce. Our study aimed to compare the habitat structure, species
   composition and diversity patterns of two distant sandy forest-steppes
   of Eurasia. We compared 72 relev,s made in the main habitat components
   (forest, forest edge and grassland) of sandy forest-steppes in three
   Hungarian and three Kazakh sites. The size of the plots was 25 m(2).
   Species number, Shannon diversity and species evenness values were
   calculated for each plot. Fidelity calculations and linear mixed effects
   models were used for the analyses. We found that the vegetation and
   diversity patterns of the two forest-steppes are similar and their
   components play important roles in maintaining landscape-scale
   diversity. Despite the higher species richness in Hungary, Shannon
   diversity was higher in Kazakhstan. The deciduous forest edges of both
   areas had significantly higher species richness than the neighbouring
   habitats (forests and grasslands); therefore they can be considered
   local biodiversity hotspots. Due to the special characteristics of this
   vegetation complex, we emphasize the high conservation value of all
   landscape components as a coherent system throughout the entire range of
   the Eurasian forest-steppe biome.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>AimTo assess contemporary and historical determinants of taxonomic and
   ecological trait turnover in birds worldwide. We tested whether
   taxonomic and trait turnover (1) are structured by regional bioclimatic
   conditions, (2) increase in relationship with topographic heterogeneity
   and environmental turnover and change according to current and
   historical environmental conditions, and (3) decrease with human
   impact.Major TaxaBirds.LocationGlobal.MethodsWe used computationally
   efficient algorithms to map the taxonomic and trait turnover of 8,040
   terrestrial bird assemblages worldwide, based on a grid with 110km x 110
   km resolution overlaid on the extent-of-occurrence maps of 7,964 bird
   species, and nine ecological traits reflecting six key aspects of bird
   ecology (diet, habitat use, thermal preference, migration, dispersal and
   body size). We used quantile regression and model selection to quantify
   the influence of biomes, environment (temperature, precipitation,
   altitudinal range, net primary productivity, Quaternary temperature and
   precipitation change) and human impact (human influence index) on bird
   turnover.ResultsBird taxonomic and trait turnover were highest in the
   north African deserts and boreal biomes. In the tropics, taxonomic
   turnover tended to be higher, but trait turnover was lower than in other
   biomes. Taxonomic and trait turnover exhibited markedly different or
   even opposing relationships with climatic and topographic gradients, but
   at their upper quantiles both types of turnover decreased with
   increasing human influence.Main conclusionsThe influence of regional,
   environmental and anthropogenic factors differ between bird taxonomic
   and trait turnover, consistent with an imprint of niche conservatism,
   environmental filtering and topographic barriers on bird regional
   assemblages. Human influence on these patterns is pervasive and
   demonstrates global biotic homogenization at a macroecological scale.</td>

   research conducted on culture heritage in the West, especially West
   Europe. It is only recently that scientists and conservators in China
   start to take on this attribute into the comprehensive understanding of
   deterioration of culture heritage and management. The First
   International Symposium on Biodeterioration and Protection of Cultural
   Heritage held on August 20-22, 2014 in Dunhuang, Gansu Province of
   People's Republic of China, marks a milestone event in the history of
   cultural heritage conservation and research in China. This event was
   also held at a very special time when Dunhuang Academy was celebrating
   its 70 years of founding since 1944 under the Republic of China of the
   time to reflect the rich history and achievements as well as new
   innovation and direction for the future. This event brought together
   more than 50 speakers and attendees from around the world and within the
   country to share and exchange current knowledge and information on a
   wide range of topics. This conference as. a platform serves as an
   important basis for further exchange of information and promotion of
   more vigorous scientific research exchange with a goal on understanding
   key issues in protection of cultural heritage not only in China but also
   around the world.</td>

   is the case of the University of Rome "La Sapienza" campus since it was
   built even before first regulations on energy saving, i.e. Italian Law
   10/91. Current energy classification assigns to them the energy
   efficiency class G, far from class A, the energy label to be achieved by
   2020.The purpose of the study is the energy refurbishment of the
   Orthopaedic and Traumatological Clinic Institute building located within
   the "Sapienza" University campus. It is a historical building of great
   architectural value, designed by Arnaldo Foschini in the 1930s. The
   proposed interventions entail the total renewal of the building
   envelope, investigated by thermographic surveys, along with the
   installations of new heating and cooling systems. The architectural
   redevelopment is according to Italian Law 338 of 14 November 2000 for
   the construction of temporary accommodations and residences. The results
   obtained were analyzed to identify the best intervention strategy for a
   sustainable energy retrofitting of historical building, taking into
   account the preservation of its architectural values as well as making
   it fit for modern use. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.</td>

   and impact of which is uncertain. In the cultural heritage sector the
   need for monitoring to inform our understanding is widely agreed, yet
   there is a lack of consensus over what constitutes 'monitoring for
   climate change'. This is due, at least in part, to the extended
   time-scales involved. In this paper the design and implementation of one
   solution is described; a sustainable legacy indicator tool (LegIT) for
   the long term tracking of surface weathering effects on built
   heritage.Results: The assessment of climate change impacts requires
   30-100 years of data collection, equal to the period referred to as the
   'climate norm' by meteorologists. The LegIT is a sacrificial stone
   object that registers changes in the severity and/or magnitude of
   weathering patterns on built surfaces, providing a legacy data source
   for future decision makers. To ensure its sustainability, careful
   thought was given to the choice of materials, data retrieval and
   archiving. The tool aims to track surface changes caused by recession,
   salt crystallisation and microbiological growth.Conclusion: The
   development and installation of the LegIT is the first long-term
   exposure trial to be initiated at heritage sites in Ireland and is
   intended as a legacy for future researchers.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Around the globe, the impacts of climate change are increasing the risk
   of catastrophic events and the resulting loss of human life and
   communities. Until now, responses to these events and planning for
   future occurrences have focused on ecological and social impacts, to the
   almost total exclusion of the impacts on heritage. Cultural heritage
   includes archaeological sites, historic buildings, and artifacts,
   but-more importantly-it also includes the meanings, values, and
   contemporary social behavior associated with these tangible forms of
   heritage. Thus, place attachment, sense of place, and associated forms
   of intangible heritage are major societal factors that must be
   integrated into climate change adaptation and risk management models.
   Communities, towns, and governments typically disassociate
   cultural/historical resources from natural resources in issues of
   planning and development. A transdisciplinary approach to cultural
   heritage is necessary in times of risk. There is critical need for this
   approach, since climate change will result in accelerated changes for
   human communities-from dislocation to a change in the physical
   manifestations of place. In this paper, we explore approaches to
   disaster, adaptation, and resilience through the lens of cultural
   heritage using two case studies: the Gullah Communities of South
   Carolina and the diverse communities of Eleuthera, Bahamas.</td>

   the recent past and it is expected to further increase due to the
   effects of sea level rise and storm surges associated with climate
   change. Losses from these floods are generally categorized as tangible
   and intangible depending on whether or not the losses can be easily
   assessed in monetary values. Compared to tangible losses, relatively few
   research studies exist where intangible losses are assessed and
   incorporated into flood risk analysis due to the lack of appropriate
   evaluation and integration methodologies. In this research study, all
   the intangible losses are assessed in nonmonetary measures using
   different approaches which were either adopted from literature or newly
   developed. Furthermore, an attempt was taken to assess the intangible
   losses in monetary values. The integration of tangible economic losses
   with the intangible losses measured in nonmonetary values was carried
   out within the framework of a multi-criteria analysis (MCA). Moreover,
   the intangible losses in monetary measures are integrated adopting the
   concept of cost-benefit analysis. The paper presents the results of the
   evaluation of intangible losses and their integration with tangible
   economic losses for the exemplary study carried out in the two XtremRisK

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Australian rangelands are rich in Indigenous cultural heritage sites and
   Indigenous rangers increasingly manage them. It is well documented that
   climate-change adaptation planning on a local scale benefits from a
   stakeholder-led or bottom-up process. However, to date, few bottom-up,
   practical adaptation pathways exist for Indigenous Australians. This
   paper describes the development of a planning tool that supports
   Indigenous rangers' plan for climate-change impacts on cultural heritage
   sites. To date, a limited number of methodologies for managing
   climate-change impacts on heritage sites have been developed
   internationally. Importantly these are not geared to a bottom-up
   planning process. By contrast, many generic adaptation decision-support
   tools exist that support bottom-up planning. These tools commonly begin
   with a scoping phase. The scoping phase of a tool that supports
   Indigenous rangers manage climate-change impacts on heritage sites is
   described. A validation model, consisting of central assumptions behind
   each element of the scoping phase, is then set out. Future testing in
   the field would involve assessment of the tool through confirmation or
   otherwise of these assumptions. The first two assumptions in the
   validation model are then addressed: that Indigenous rangers perceive
   climate-change impacts on heritage sites and that planning for them is a
   priority need. Previous literature has not addressed these questions in
   detail. Only if positive responses are gained for these foundational
   assumptions can future testing of the tool be justified. Results from
   preliminary fieldwork undertaken in northern Australia found Indigenous
   rangers in two out of three case studies perceive impacts on heritage
   sites, and regard addressing these impacts as a priority.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper uses the water-reallocation scheme created within the
   National Water Act (1998) to analyze the impacts of water policy on farm
   livelihoods in South Africa. Based on one of the most water stressed
   catchments in the country, the Olifants river basin, we provide an
   integrated modeling approach combining water and agricultural modules to
   investigate the impacts of compulsory licensing and water market on crop
   production and investment made to improve water use efficiency. The
   model maximizes net farm profits and takes into account the
   characteristics of the agricultural sector in the region in classifying
   farmers between large-scale (LSFs) and emerging (EFs) groups, according
   to their land acreage, irrigation efficiency and historical heritage.
   Compulsory licensing is analyzed through curtailment of water-use rights
   from large-scale to emerging farmers. The water market is investigated
   to provide conditions under which farms trade water to complete their
   irrigation schedules. Our results show that, though compulsory licensing
   might promote a rise in emerging farmers and a re-balance of past
   riparian-based water allocation schemes, care should be given to the
   level of that curtailment rate in order to balance equity measures with
   efficiency objectives. Indeed, we found that the losses associated with
   water curtailment for LSFs are not entirely captured by the EFs.
   Therefore, beyond water policy, there are other factors, which also
   influence farms' profits and water use efficiency. The results also
   demonstrate that a water market provides a good opportunity to increase
   water use efficiency. The introduction of water market induces LSFs with
   good water storage facilities a possibility to trade their remaining
   water-use rights. It also offers EFs an alternative to diversify their
   water supply sources when they encounter shortfalls in amount of water
   allocated. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The black fly Simulium aureohirtum Brunetti (Diptera: Simuliidae) is
   geographically widespread and utilizes diverse habitats. Previous
   studies revealed high genetic diversity, suggesting that this species
   could be a species complex. In this study, we used mitochondrial
   cytochrome c oxidase II sequences to examine genetic structure and
   demographic history of S. aureohirtum in Thailand. High level of genetic
   variation was observed due to the existence of genetically divergent
   lineages (A, B, and C). Lineages A and C were geographically widespread,
   while lineage B was geographically restricted to the eastern part of
   Thailand. The geographic localization of lineage B suggested limitations
   in gene flow, which is most likely a result of ecologically different
   habitats. Large genetic differences between individuals of lineages A
   and C, but geographically sympatric distributions of the members of
   these lineages, are considered to represent an admixture of the
   populations that have evolved allopatrically. Historical environmental
   change during the Pleistocene glaciations is possibly the factor that
   drove the lineage divergence. Population demographic history analyses
   revealed recent population expansions in the three lineages dating back
   to the last glaciations. These observations further highlight the
   significance of the Pleistocene climatic change on current genetic
   structure and diversity of living organisms of the Southeast Asian
   mainland.</td>

   perceptions of tensions between the implementation of an energy policy
   and the practice of traditional culture. The energy policy calls for
   public actions to conserve energy and reduce carbon emissions. The
   research participants are 94 people, selected by balancing sexes, ages,
   and residential areas, from a wide range of vocations. The research data
   were collected by semi-structured interview with the participants
   individually. Interview questions were designed to elicit the
   participants' constructs, beliefs, behaviours, and tensions in relation
   to energy policy and traditional culture. Data analysis was performed
   based on a qualitative methodology by the procedure of open coding,
   theme finding, constant comparison, and theory generation. The analysis
   identifies four tensions: (1) tensions in knowledge bases between energy
   conservation and carbon reduction, (2) tensions in lifestyles between
   having and being, (3) tensions in social systems between authority and
   conformity, and (4) tensions in creation boundaries between technology
   and nature. The themes underlying the four tensions are uncertainty,
   pleasure, power, and control, respectively. Solutions to the four
   tensions may include practical knowledge, pragmatic idealism,
   hierarchical collaboration, and sustainable innovation. (C) 2012

   timber in historic buildings and archaeological sites, using tree-ring
   data which cover a 1000 year period. This records a millennium of
   enormous changes in the timber supply in Scotland. Prior to 1450, native
   oak dominates the record, much of it long-lived material originating in
   the 10th and 11th centuries. In the mid 15th century, at a time when the
   state recognises the degradation of the Scottish woodlands, there is an
   almost wholesale shift to imported oak timber which persists into the
   17th century. At this time, Norway cuts off its oak supplies and
   imported pine becomes most prevalent thereafter. The reasons for the
   demise of native oak timber are considered in the context of possible
   inadequacies in resource management in the face of a worsening climate.
   The tree-ring evidence for the later, and largely localised,
   exploitation of the native pinewoods for timber is also considered.</td>

   broader understanding of climate change, particularly as it affects
   heritage in the developing world, especially that of indigenous peoples
   and small Island states. This is also a call for political engagement by
   heritage practitioners. We argue that in the struggle against climate
   change heritage practitioners can make a worthwhile contribution by
   arguing for a de-commodified form of heritage practice emphasizing the
   involvement of local communities and recognition of their cultural
   resources; that resists being coopted into economic growth strategies
   unless they supplant other forms of unsustainable development; that
   focuses on heritage as an alternative way of viewing resources and their

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper poses the question as to whether the vineyards of the Lavaux
   region in the eastern part of Lake Geneva, Switzerland, will be able to
   maintain in a future greenhouse climate the same 'cultural landscape' as
   presently. It is indeed this landscape which has recently been placed on
   the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites, but whether it will remain as
   it has since the 13th century is an open question. The projected shifts
   in temperature and moisture patterns from current to future climate
   suggest that the grape varieties cultivated in the Lavaux region are
   likely to be subject to increasing heat and drought stress. As a result,
   the grape varieties that are currently cultivated in the region may no
   longer be sustainable; however, the visual aspect of the vineyards could
   be maintained if other grape varieties were to be planted, for example
   those that are endemic to warmer and drier Mediterranean-type climates.
   The scenery of the region would thus remain close to what it is today,
   even though the wine produced from other types of grape would certainly
   be different from those for which the Lavaux has become famous over the
   centuries. Copyright (C) 2007 Royal Meteorological Society.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Wind-driven rain (WDR) is rain given a horizontal velocity component by
   wind and falling obliquely. It is a prominent environmental risk to
   built heritage, as it contributes to the damage of porous building
   materials and building element failure. While predicted climate trends
   are well-established, how they will specifically manifest in future WDR
   is uncertain. This paper combines UKCP09 Weather Generator predictions
   with a probabilistic process to create hourly time series of climate
   parameters under a high-emissions scenario for 2070-2099 at eight UK
   sites. Exposure to WDR at these sites for baseline and future periods is
   calculated from semi-empirical models based on long-term hourly
   meteorological data using ISO 15927-3: 2009. Towards the end of the
   twenty-first century, it is predicted that rain spells will have higher
   volumes, i.e. a higher quantity of water will impact facades, across all
   8 sites. Although the average number of spells is predicted to remain
   constant, they will be shorter with longer of periods of time between
   them and more intense with wind-driven rain occurring for a greater
   proportion of hours within them. It is likely that in this scenario
   building element failure-such as moisture ingress through cracks and
   gutter over-spill-will occur more frequently. There will be higher rates
   of moisture cycling and enhanced deep-seated wetting. These predicted
   changes require new metrics for wind-driven rain to be developed, so
   that future impacts can be managed effectively and efficiently. (c) 2018

   are dated to before 1537 and include wooden buildings as well as 10
   medieval churches built in stone while the remaining 10 buildings are
   situated in the World Heritage sites of Bryggen, in Bergen on the west
   coast of Norway, and in ROros, which is a mining town in the inland of
   the country. The monitoring is planned to run for 30 to 50 years. It
   includes a zero-level registration and an interval-based registration
   system focused on relevant indicators, which will make it possible to
   register climate change-induced decay at an early stage.</td>

   recognised from a physical point of view, but the influence of WDR on
   Biological Growth (BG) on stone materials to cause biodeterioration is
   still not well studied. Following our previous results from the Roman
   area, the UNESCO site of Pompeii for its importance was selected to
   further test relationships between WDR and BG. We collated and analysed
   climatic data (rainfall, direction and intensity of winds) between 2010
   and 2015 to delineate the thermo-pluvial diagram and extrapolate
   Dominant Winds (DW) and WDR. Data on BG, consisting mainly of
   cyanobacteria, algae and lichens, were also collected through sampling,
   direct observations and analysis of high-quality photos. The climatic
   elaborations highlighted a dominance of the West wind influencing WDR.
   The BG was more prominent on the northern and western exposures, while
   it was considerably less extensive on the southern walls. Our results
   also showed that water from WDR, together with the lower temperature in
   the northern exposure and poor ventilation, can all affect wetness and
   had a profound role in the promotion of BG. Our analyses suggest that
   the protection of building walls should be different according to the
   exposure conditions in the formulation of preventive strategies for
   conservation.</td>

   greater exposure to severe weather events, has led to the need for
   adapting cultural heritage to climate change. However, there is limited
   research accomplished to date on the process of adaptation of cultural
   heritage to climate change. This paper examines the perceptions of
   experts involved in the management and preservation of cultural heritage
   on adaptation to climate change risks. For this purpose, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with experts from the UK, Italy, and Norway as
   well as a participatory workshop with stakeholders. The results indicate
   that the majority of interviewees believe that adaptation of cultural
   heritage to climate change is possible. Opportunities for, barriers to,
   and requirements for adapting cultural heritage to climate change, as
   perceived by the interviewees, provided a better understanding of what
   needs to be provided and prioritized for adaptation to take place and in
   its strategic planning. Knowledge of management methodologies
   incorporating climate change impacts by the interviewees together with
   best practice examples in adapting cultural heritage to climate change
   are also reported. Finally, the interviewees identified the determinant
   factors for the implementation of climate change adaptation. This paper
   highlights the need for more research on this topic and the
   identification and dissemination of practical solutions and tools for
   the incorporation of climate change adaptation in the preservation and
   management of cultural heritage.</td>

   the main responsible of the damage of calcareous stones. However the
   mechanisms of degradation of the stone and the factors that affect them
   cannot be simply specified, due to the sum coupled processes involving
   physical, chemical and biological changes, associated with capillarity
   and porosity, on the other hand the management of large number of
   samples and the cost of characterization analysis, modeling can
   contemplate a tool for the care and protection of real estate over
   time.Reason why this work shows a bibliographical review of the
   mathematical models that aim to describe how the deterioration of the
   surfaces of these structures varies over time, with particular attention
   to surface recession of stone, as a function of sets of variables that
   have been considered determinants in the different cases studied. It has
   been shown that in the last 30 years the models has had a revealing
   evolution due to the fact that the phenomenon has been gradually
   understood, putting in the background variables such as SO2 because of
   its reduction worldwide, and introducing variables such as HNO3 which
   has had, on the contrary, increasing values.In addition, it has been
   shown that linear polynomials, even if they lend themselves well to
   represent the phenomenon, in the last 10 years have been replaced by
   equations or systems of differential equations with one or more
   variables taken into account. Finally, it was revealed the lack of an
   inclusive model, capable of including all possible deterioration
   processes, and that time by time can be adapted to different case
   studies, in different parts of the world and with different conditions
   nearby, at least for structures with similar materials. Theoretical
   concepts of how an ideal model should be structured are finally
   proposed.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Today, cultural heritage planning and decision-making operate under
   considerable climate, political, and financial uncertainties and
   constraints. Consequently, decision-makers are often left making
   value-laden judgments of what to preserve, restore, and maintain in
   their best judgments, which can leave them open to criticism for not
   protecting the cultural resources most important to various and diverse
   stakeholder groups. Thus, a transparent and robust process to optimally
   maintain cultural heritage values for present and future generations is
   needed. We address this knowledge gap by developing a novel,
   transparent, and value-based measurement framework for assessing
   relative "historical significance" and "use potential" of diverse
   historic buildings listed on the National Register of Historic Places
   (United States). Measures of historical significance include: the
   association of a building with the purpose of a NPS site's foundation,
   the current physical condition of a building, the building's historic
   character, and National Register listing criteria. Specific measures of
   use potential consider the importance of historic building's
   operational, third party, visitor, interpretative, and scientific uses.
   The application of the framework is presented using a subset of
   buildings located within two separately listed historic districts at
   Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. The framework focuses on
   the current status of the cultural resource's significance and use
   potential while acknowledging that corresponding attributes, metrics and
   weights can change over time and should be regularly updated. It is
   hoped that the historical significance and use potential framework can
   assist the decision-makers and stakeholders, and better inform both the
   cultural heritage management and allocation prioritization for climate
   adaptation planning when it is applied in tandem with climate change
   vulnerability assessments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A marine protected area (MPA) is an area of the ocean designated for the
   conservation and protection of natural or cultural resources. MPAs are
   spatial tools used to preserve the ecological integrity and biodiversity
   of an area, protecting ecosystem functions, species and habitats for
   future generations. In 2015, the Canadian government committed to
   increasing protection of its coastal and marine areas up to 10% by 2020.
   To reach this goal, the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)
   is currently in the process of designing and implementing a network of
   MPAs in the Maritimes Region, on the Atlantic coast of Canada. The
   design process needs to consider population connectivity, which in turn
   requires an understanding of life-histories for target species (i.e. the
   movement of adults and the dispersal of larval life-stages). The
   population parameters that repeatedly emerge as necessary for deriving
   estimates of MPA dimensions include the spatial distribution of the
   conservation priority (species or habitat), movement patterns and
   oceanographic processes. A decision tree was developed that uses
   information on species larval dispersal, and juvenile, and adult
   movement to provide guidelines that can inform definition of size and
   spacing of individual MPAs in a network. Case studies of species
   targeted for protection on the Scotian Shelf are presented, to
   illustrate its use. The decision tree can be used as a tool to help
   design networks that ensure population connectivity where there is a
   paucity of biological information, or as a quality control method for
   assessing other spatial design tools.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper documents the evolution of the urban geomorphological setting
   of the historical heart of the city of Genoa (Liguria, Italy). Since the
   Middle Ages, the city and its harbour have progressively grown, reaching
   their greatest extent in the 1950s. Today it has an area of 8.5 km(2)
   and it includes seven small catchments with surfaces ranging from 0.5 to
   2.4 km(2) . Their urbanized surface ranges from just less than 30% up to
   more than 80%. Human interventions have almost completely reshaped and
   modified the original morphology. The identification of artificial
   landforms built over the former natural landforms was carried OM through
   multi-temporal cartographical and photographical comparison, and the
   analysis of geo-thematic cartography and documentation by the Basin
   Master Plan (Piano di Bacino) and Genoa City Hall Plan. In addition
   stratigraphy data from the regional database were analysed and several
   geomorphological surveys were carried out in the area. Artificial
   landforms were mapped by applying an experimental geomorphological
   classification currently being developed by the Working Groups of the
   Italian Association of Physical Geography and Geomorphology (AIGEO). The
   main geomorphic modifications are: slope fillings retained by walls
   (mainly due to roads and buildings); excavation areas (often connected
   to historical quarries); sea embankments (for harbour growth) and
   artificial modifications of the drainage network (culverts, stream
   diversions and canals). All of these reduced the flow sections. These
   morphological changes have significantly increased the geo-hydrological
   risk in Genoa, which is currently one of the most emblematic Italian
   case studies for recurrent flood events, especially in the light of the
   modified rainfall regime due to recent climate change.</td>

   Yellow Water wetland on Kakadu National Park as a case study. The
   approach includes the application of a diagnostic framework to portray
   the existing SES configuration, including governance structures, in
   combination with qualitative modelling and Bayesian belief networks.
   Although SLR is predicted to cause saltwater inundation of freshwater
   ecosystems, cultural sites and built infrastructure, our study suggested
   that it may provide also an opportunity to bring together Indigenous and
   non-Indigenous knowledge and governance systems, towards a commonly
   perceived threat. Where feasible, mitigation actions such as levees may
   be required to manage local SLR impacts to protect important freshwater
   values. In contrast, adaptation will require strategies that facilitate
   participation by Kakadu Bininj (the Aboriginal people of Kakadu National
   Park) in research and monitoring programs that enhance understanding of
   salinity impacts and the adaptive capacity to respond to reasonably
   rapid, profound and irreversible future landscape-scale changes.</td>

   using the newly developed specific climate risk assessment. When using
   this method of damage assessment on buildings with active climate

   they were designed by taking into consideration the environment and all
   the local conditions. However, nowadays not only their environment is
   changing fast. According to a current climatic change analysis, the
   climate all over the world has already suffered a severe change and,
   unfortunately, future scenarios indicate an even worse situation. The
   main effects of the climate change are as follows: high and long lasting
   temperatures during summer, precipitation pattern change,
   intensification of the local winds. To which we can add more intense or
   even frequent extreme events, such as: drought, abundant precipitation,
   snowfalls and hailstorms. All these changes have a heavily impact not
   only on the historic buildings, but also on the economy and society. The
   main purpose of this study to analyse the climatic change on different
   types of historic buildings, the way in which natural factors increase
   the degradation and the failure of the building structures/historic
   architectural details and how it can affect the aesthetics of the
   historic urban centres. The subject of the research was a small town in
   Romania, Oravita, which was chosen due to its diversity of its
   historical heritage and its special climatic condition. The study
   focused on simple buildings as well as on archaeological sites,
   railroads, bridges and dams.</td>

   immovable cultural heritage (ICH). In the last few decades, the global
   impact of natural hazards on cultural heritage appears to be growing,
   which in part, may be a response to the changes in the intensity and
   frequency of geomorphological processes in the light of climate and
   environmental change. Research undertaken at present by geographers,
   geologists, archaeologists, conservationists, and other specialists,
   shows significant interest in the protection, assessment, and mitigation
   of natural risk phenomena on ICH. However, attempts of evaluating the
   present state, and to predict the future degradation of cultural
   heritage is a real challenge. A review of the published literature
   indicates that the emergence of studies focused on the degradation of
   ICH by natural hazards started approximately 40 years ago, with an
   increasing trend starting from early in the 21st century; Europe is the
   most studied area globally. These studies demonstrate that conservation
   measures need to be implemented to protect and prevent further
   degradation of the world's cultural heritage, to preserve a legacy for
   future generations.</td>

   through which audiences can experience climate change. Building on
   reviews published in WIREs Climate Change on images, films, drama,
   climate science fiction, and other literary forms, we examine how audio
   and visual art addresses the enduring problems of climate change
   communication. We begin with three of these problems: climate change's
   often abstract nature, the distances in time and space between those who
   cause climate change and the places its effects are felt, and forms of
   humanenvironmental relations that shape how climate is understood. We
   reflect on how, through a combination of vision and sound, art creates
   sensory experiences that tackle these challenges. In querying how our
   artistic examples bring about environmental engagements, we combine an
   analysis of the representations and narratives of these works with an
   appreciation of their aesthetic form-in short, how these art pieces
   activate emotional and experiential responses. While we recognize the
   limits of what art can do, especially the gallery-based forms of work we
   study here, we argue that spending time exploring the encounters that
   art creates helps us to understand what it brings to the communication
   of climate change. It also demonstrates how lessons learnt about sensory
   experience, affect, and emotions might be more widely applied to the
   analysis of cultural forms-from literature to films- and their role in
   climate change communication. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</td>

   endemism (PE), an indicator of potential refugia, to test PE for
   correlations with current and historical environmental predictors, and
   to evaluate the effectiveness of current protected areas at conserving
   evolutionary history.LocationCoastal Forests of Eastern Africa (CFEA)
   and the adjacent low-elevation Eastern Afromontane (EA).MethodsWe
   integrated new and existing spatial and phylogenetic data to map PE for
   almost the full amphibian assemblage (41 of 55 species), including 35
   intraspecific lineages from several species and complexes showing high
   phylogeographic structure. Using spatial and non-spatial regressive
   models, we tested whether PE can be predicted by measures of Quaternary
   climate change, forest stability, topographic heterogeneity and current
   climate. PE results were intersected with the protected area network to
   evaluate current conservation effectiveness.ResultsWe detect refugia in
   Tanzania and coastal Kenya previously identified as CFEA centres of
   endemism but also new areas (lowland Tanga region and Pangani river,
   Zaraninge forest, Mafia island, Matumbi hills). Results show that
   refugia for amphibians (high PE) are located in areas with long-term
   Quaternary climate stability and benign current climate (high
   precipitation of driest quarter, high annual precipitation), with
   climatically unstable areas demonstrating low PE. Conservation analyses
   revealed that ten PE hotspots account for over 25% of the total PE, but
   only small parts of these areas are under conservation protection.Main
   ConclusionsUtilizing cryptic diversity from novel phylogeographic data
   and distribution modelling improves our understanding of endemism
   patterns, with climate stability being strongly correlated with the
   distribution of PE. Our analyses point towards high PE areas being
   refugia, which require an urgent need to consolidate protected areas
   within centres of endemism in this highly threatened biodiversity
   hotspot.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Low-lying coastal areas are often prone to storm surge flooding that can
   render severe damages to properties, destruction of habitats, threat to
   human safety and the environment. The impacts of coastal flooding are
   also expected to increase in the future as a consequence of global
   climate change and sea-level rise. This paper presents a comprehensive
   assessment of the potential risks raised by storm surge and sea-level
   rise on multiple coastal targets (i.e., population, buildings,
   infrastructures, agriculture, natural and semi-natural environments and
   cultural heritage) in the Northern Adriatic coast in Italy. Through the
   assessment of hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, a Regional Risk
   Assessment (RRA) methodology allowed identifying and prioritizing
   hot-spot risk areas and targets requiring particular attention for the
   definition of adaptation strategies. Hazard scenarios were based on the
   analysis of tide gauge data (elaborated with the Joint Probability
   Method) and of different sea-level rise projections for the year 2100.
   Geographical-information analysis was then used to characterize
   vulnerability patterns of exposed natural and human systems and to make
   a spatial ranking of risks. Maps produced for the worst scenario showed
   that beaches are the target at higher risk (with more than 90% of the
   surface in the higher relative risk class) due to the low elevation and
   high proximity to the coastline. Also cultural heritage (i.e., villas,
   historical buildings and roads) and wetlands are highly threatened by
   storm surge flooding. The relative risks will be lower (i.e., between
   25% and 40% of their surface/length in the higher relative risk class)
   for most of the other receptors (i.e., local roads, railways, natural
   and semi-natural environments and agricultural areas), including
   population and buildings that are mostly classified in lower risk
   classes. The overall results of the assessment, including maps and risk
   metrics, can be useful to rise the attention of coastal managers about
   the need to adapt to climate change, developing climate-proof policies
   and programs for the sustainable management of coastal zones.</td>

   recent environmental and climatic changes. Based on household survey our
   study provides data on i) how local farmers perceive climate change in
   general, ii) prevailing freshwater aquaculture scenarios and potential
   impacts of the climate change on aquaculture, and iii) which strategies
   aquaculture farmers employ to cope with the perceived risks. The study
   reveals that farmers are aware of climatic variability and express their
   experiences of changes in temperature, rainfall, tropical cyclones and
   sea level rise. The production methods of freshwater aquaculture in
   Sundarban can be termed as 'semi-improved low-input carp polyculture'.
   Cyclones and storm surges are the most significant climatic phenomena
   and severely affect freshwater aquaculture due to subsequent coastal
   flooding, and sea-level rise that cumulatively lead to salinity
   intrusion, followed by rising air temperature and drought. In relation
   to perceived risks, farmers are currently dealing with the problems
   through short-term coping measures which need scientific improvements to
   give long-term relief to the farmers. Considering the effects of climate
   change on freshwater pond aquaculture in the delta, we propose some
   preliminary policy recommendations that need to be introduced to cope
   with the challenges.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>During last decades, the international community has become aware of the
   need to adapt to the effects of climate change, as the sensitivity of
   natural and human systems gained relevance. Europe is one of the most
   urbanized regions, accounting for a 73% of people living in urban areas.
   This share, together with the increase of urban land take, has
   concentrated the fight against climate change in cities, which are
   considered as one of the most vulnerable areas.European cities are
   characterised by a wide range of cultural heritage, which is commonly
   located in what is defined as the historic city. In order to protect
   urban heritage from a changing environment, emphasis should be given to
   the integration of conservation management and urban planning
   strategies, within wider goals of local sustainable development.Historic
   cities have a great potential in contributing to local economy and
   enhancing investment climate. Modern conservation strategies need to
   address a balance between urban growth and quality of life in a
   sustainable way. They should match the interrelationships of existing
   building stock, spatial organization, natural characteristics and
   social, cultural and economic values. Furthermore, the need to address a
   new generation of strategies, adapted to new climatic scenarios, should
   be considered as a priority for an effective management of the whole
   city. The proposed paper presents research results of the ADVICE
   project, based on a multiscale approach for the management of climate
   change impacts on cultural heritage located in the urban
   context.Vulnerability is addressed for different types of heritage, both
   at urban or building scale, considering their singularities as well as
   the context in which they are included. This will permit addressing the
   overall urban scale, together with data at structure level. Adaptive
   measures in general can be of a preventive character and improve
   resilience yet they can also offer preparative support when dealing with
   the anticipated effects of climate change and extreme events. In order
   to be effective, they need to be addressed according to the typology of
   object to be protected and to the scale of the impact or disaster they
   are facing. Vulnerability mapping is one of the first steps in
   clarifying the challenges which climate change pose for a city and its
   stakeholders. Assessment of climate change impacts and vulnerability
   vary widely, depending on the subject, time frame, geographic coverage
   and purpose of the assessment. KPIs are therefore needed to address the
   overall as well as the specific vulnerability and exposure for risk
   scoring, in order to propose effective adaptive measures.Information is
   supported by a data model for the creation of an evidence-based decision
   making platform, which will contribute to a more educated and
   data-driven decision making process. This will permit eliminating one of
   the barriers to the effective implementation of climate change
   adaptation strategies by cultural heritage managers and public
   authorities.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Purpose - The purpose of this paper was to develop an integrated
   framework for assessing the flood risk and climate adaptation capacity
   of an urban area and its critical infrastructures to help address flood
   risk management issues and identify climate adaptation
   strategies.Design/methodology/approach - Using the January 2011 flood in
   the core suburbs of Brisbane City, Queensland, Australia, various
   spatial analytical tools (i.e. digital elevation modeling and urban
   morphological characterization with 3D analysis, spatial analysis with
   fuzzy logic, proximity analysis, line statistics, quadrat analysis,
   collect events analysis, spatial autocorrelation techniques with global
   Moran's I and local Moran's I, inverse distance weight method, and hot
   spot analysis) were implemented to transform and standardize hazard,
   vulnerability, and exposure indicating variables. The issue on the
   sufficiency of indicating variables was addressed using the topological
   cluster analysis of a two-dimension self-organizing neural network
   (SONN) structured with 100 neurons and trained by 200 epochs.
   Furthermore, the suitability of flood risk modeling was addressed by
   aggregating the indicating variables with weighted overlay and modified
   fuzzy gamma overlay operations using the Bayesian joint conditional
   probability weights. Variable weights were assigned to address the
   limitations of normative (equal weights) and deductive (expert judgment)
   approaches. Applying geographic information system (GIS) and appropriate
   equations, the flood risk and climate adaptation capacity indices of the
   study area were calculated and corresponding maps were
   generated.Findings - The analyses showed that on the average, 36
   (approximately 813 ha) and 14 per cent (approximately 316 ha) of the
   study area were exposed to very high flood risk and low adaptation
   capacity, respectively. In total, 93 per cent of the study area revealed
   negative adaptation capacity metrics (i.e. minimum of -23 to &lt;0), which
   implies that the socio-economic resources in the area are not enough to
   increase climate resilience of the urban community (i.e. Brisbane City)
   and its critical infrastructures.Research limitations/implications -
   While the framework in this study was obtained through a robust
   approach, the following are the research limitations and recommended for
   further examination: analyzing and incorporating the impacts of economic
   growth; population growth; technological advancement; climate and
   environmental disturbances; and climate change; and applying the
   framework in assessing the risks to natural environments such as in
   agricultural areas, forest protection and production areas, biodiversity
   conservation areas, natural heritage sites, watersheds or river basins,
   parks and recreation areas, coastal regions, etc.Practical implications
   - This study provides a tool for high level analyses and identifies
   adaptation strategies to enable urban communities and critical
   infrastructure industries to better prepare and mitigate future flood
   events. The disaster risk reduction measures and climate adaptation
   strategies to increase urban community and critical infrastructure
   resilience were identified in this study. These include mitigation on
   areas of low flood risk or very high climate adaptation capacity;
   mitigation to preparedness on areas of moderate flood risk and high
   climate adaptation capacity; mitigation to response on areas of high
   flood risk and moderate climate adaptation capacity; and mitigation to
   recovery on areas of very high flood risk and low climate adaptation
   capacity. The implications of integrating disaster risk reduction and
   climate adaptation strategies were further examined.Originality/value -
   The newly developed spatially explicit analytical technique, identified
   in this study as the Flood Risk-Adaptation Capacity Index-Adaptation
   Strategies (FRACIAS) Linkage/Integrated Model, allows the integration of
   flood risk and climate adaptation assessments which had been treated
   separately in the past. By applying the FRACIAS linkage/integrated model
   in the context of flood risk and climate adaptation capacity
   assessments, the authors established a framework for enhancing measures
   and adaptation strategies to increase urban community and critical
   infrastructure resilience to flood risk and climate-related events.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>National parks of the United States seek to preserve the natural and
   cultural heritage of the United States, yet parks in the eastern and
   Midwestern United States were established after periods of human
   settlement and disturbance. In the Great Lakes region, fire and windfall
   originally dominated as disturbance agents, driving dynamics in
   prairies, savannas, and in many forested ecosystems. How- ever, fire
   suppression over the last century has radically lengthened fire return
   intervals. Additionally, widespread logging, slash burning, mining, and
   agricultural settlement successively shifted the dominant forms of land
   use, greatly altering these forests. From 2008 to 2014, the National
   Park Service's Great Lakes Inventory and Monitoring Program surveyed
   vegetation in nine Great Lakes National Parks. We compared these surveys
   with data derived from the mid-to late-1800s Public Land Survey (PLS) to
   assess shifts in forest composition. Community composition has changed
   dramatically since the mid-19th century. Preferred timber species (e.g.,
   Pinus strobus and Tsuga canadensis) and fire-adapted species (e.g.,
   Quercus macrocarpa and Pinus banksiana) have declined across the region,
   while aspen (Populus spp.) and/or maple (Acer spp.) have consistently
   increased. Ordinations reveal both these general trends and substantial
   divergence in composition within particular parks since the PLS. Past
   logging practices and mesification following fire suppression account
   for most general trends across the region, while local differences in
   edaphic conditions, ungulate herbivory, and disturbance regimes account
   for many park-to-park differences. Understanding how these factors,
   alone and in combination, have affected forests in these parks provides
   both a picture of regional forest dynamics and tools that improve our
   ability to manage these parks. Continuing to monitor forest vegetation
   in these parks will allow us to test our - understanding of forest
   dynamics and to use these parks as the "land laboratories" that Leopold
   envisioned.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>1. Waterbirds are increasingly affected by climate change and human
   disturbances to the wetlands on which they roost, forage and breed. The
   evolutionary response of populations to such changes is influenced by
   genetic variability and gene flow patterns, which enable long-term
   survival. Thus, genetic monitoring of waterbird populations can provide
   valuable information to support conservation measures and management
   policies for wetlands. 2. This study assessed past and contemporary
   levels of genetic diversity, estimated effective population sizes (Ne)
   and investigated gene flow patterns among populations of the great
   egret, Ardea alba egretta, settled in major Brazilian wetlands. 3.
   Samples (N = 200) were collected from the northern, central western,
   south-eastern and southern regions of Brazil. AMOVA, F-statistics,
   assignment tests, Bayesian clustering analyses and Ne were estimated
   based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and microsatellite loci. 4. The
   populations share most mitochondrial haplotypes, suggesting a common
   recent past. Mismatch analyses, Fs and D statistics, and SSD and Rg
   indices indicated significant signs of expansion in most populations.
   The time since expansion suggests that egrets colonized southern
   latitudes more recently, probably accompanying the supposed historical
   environmental changes in South America, with more stable habitats toward
   equatorial regions. 5. MtDNA.ST revealed significant differentiation
   between the northern and both the central western and southern
   populations. Nuclear loci demonstrated significant structuring between
   the central western and southern populations, which showed similar
   effective sizes. 6. Despite the considerable dispersal potential of the
   great egret, there is limited gene flow among populations located in
   different Brazilian wetlands. Therefore, colonies from different regions
   should be preserved, with special attention to the northern populations,
   whose allelic constitution differs from the other. This approach can be
   used to genetically monitor similar species in other wetlands or to
   great egret populations in other regions of the Americas. Copyright #

   operations, was studied with POM and SEM-EDS. Particulate matter
   deposited on surfaces in the same period was analyzed with XRD and IC.
   Climate change in the environs was also studied and facade coloring

   addressed when designing conservation strategies. Domestic heating
   systems and vehicle traffic were identified as the two main sources of
   pollution throughout the period studied in the target area, where the
   temperature steadily rose and relative humidity declined. The
   progressive replacement of coal with gas oil in domestic heating boilers
   and the proliferation of vehicles with diesel engines have mostly

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Cultural heritage represents the legacy of human being to the planet
   earth. It is the evidence of 1,000 years of past generation evolution,
   to adapt our living condition to environment. Cultural heritage can be
   intangible (e.g. tradition, custom) and tangible, the latter including
   various physical objects, from historic landscapes and human transformed
   landscapes to sacred sites, archaeological sites, monumental sculpture,
   monumental painting, architecture and town planning. The above sites and
   remains are clearly not in equilibrium with environment. They are
   continuously impacted and weathered by several internal and external
   factors, both natural and human, with rapid and slow onset. Natural
   hazards are a clear example of such factors as well as long term
   weathering decay of rocks, until the effect of climate change, without
   disregarding the role of men, especially in war areas. In this context,
   an essential role on conservation and management of cultural properties
   has been identified by engineering geology and earth science in general.
   This approach was not very evident in the past, and now more attention
   to the integration of different sciences is demanded. Indeed, it is
   possible to affirm that the protection of the cultural heritage
   represents an interdisciplinary process (and not multi-disciplinary) at
   the border-line among art, history, science, policies for management and
   exploitation. In recent decades, many significant sites of cultural
   heritage have suffered damage, occasionally irreversible, from natural
   processes. This paper is presenting some case studies developed by
   United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
   (UNESCO) to protect and maintain important cultural heritage sites and
   historic urban landscapes, mainly in Country of the world recently

   are expected to impact material cultural heritage in Puerto Rico. As
   case study, we also conducted a spatial analysis vulnerability
   assessment of coastal heritage sites below 20 meters in elevation.
   Results from the analysis show that of the 1185 known cultural heritage
   sites below 20 meters in elevation in Puerto Rico, 27 sites are
   inundated at today's highest high tide, 56 will be inundated by
   mid-century when assuming a 0.6 m rise in sea-level, and 140 sites will
   be inundated by end-of-century when assuming a 1.8 m rise in sea-level.
   Spatial analysis of sites adjacent to the high tide line demonstrate
   that these values are likely conservative, as there are many sites
   located within 1 m of the highest high tide line that should also be
   considered vulnerable. Finally, we present and introductory proposal
   that addresses the need for vulnerability assessments to aid cultural
   heritage managers in developing adaptive strategies for climate change
   impacts to material heritage. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

   for preserving the historic building materials, as stated in the recent
   Code for protection of Cultural Heritage, in Italy (2004).Rising damp is
   a recurrent cause of damage, and the climatic changes are going toward
   the increase of humidity in the historic masonry: at 40/50. latitudes,
   at continental/Mediterranean climatic conditions, the alternance of dry
   seasons and almost monsonic seasons dramatically affects the
   distribution of rising damp in porous materials, as well as the water
   content. The evaporation of rising damp from the wet surface due to
   occasional or seasonal change of air temperature, causes the major
   damage due to salts crystallization. The evaluation of the increase of
   water inside the masonry is a critical issue for preventing the damages,
   because the presence of the water can sharply, naturally decrease in the
   dry seasons, as well as rapidly increases one month or more after the
   beginning of heavy and constant rain.The interventions against water
   intruding the masonry due to water table or rainfalls that are not
   properly taken away from the structure are totally different, although
   the damages caused by both these causes are the same.Monitoring the
   presence and distribution of the water is useful to support the choice
   of the most appropriate intervention, reducing the risk to apply not
   effective and expensive products and preventing an oversize

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Global demand for seaweed has increased dramatically over recent decades
   and the potential for seaweed aquaculture to address issues around food
   security and climate-change mitigation are being recognised. Australia
   is a global hotspot for seaweed biodiversity with a rich, diverse
   Indigenous history dating back 65,000 years, including an extensive
   traditional knowledge of Australian natural resources. In our present
   review of archival literature, we explored the contemporary and
   historical uses and cultural significance of seaweeds to Indigenous
   Australians. We found records of seaweed use by Indigenous Saltwater
   Australians (Australian Aboriginal peoples from coastal areas across the
   nation who are the Traditional Owners/Guardians and custodians of the
   lands and waters characterised by saltwater environment) for a variety
   of purposes including cultural activities, ceremonial activities,
   medicinal uses, clothing, cultural history, food, fishing, shelter and
   domestic uses. Species-specific records were rarely recorded (and/or
   accurately translated) in the archival literature, with the exception of
   the use of the fucoid bull kelp, Durvillaea potatorum, which was
   prevalent. Our research is a step forward in the important task of
   recovering and conserving Indigenous Australian knowledge and customary
   traditions surrounding coastal resource use. Unlocking this knowledge
   creates opportunities for the continuance and revitalization of
   traditional customary practises that may enable innovative Indigenous
   business activities and product creation, based around food, sustainable
   natural-fibre technologies and health. Such research also has the
   potential to enhance a developing Australian seaweed industry by guiding
   species selection, preparation, use and sustainable resource management.
   We recommend our findings are used to inform the direction and locations
   of further research conducted in conjunction with Indigenous coastal
   communities in Australia's temperate regions, to explore in more detail
   the Indigenous Australian's historical heritage associated with coastal
   seaweed resources and their uses.</td>

   foundation and potential principles or approaches. Secondly, using the
   case study of Hongcun to explain, support, and validate the HNIEP model
   and its framework, the study found that the unique planning and
   construction of Hongcun has greatly promoted ecosystem services, such as
   local microclimate regulation, rainwater runoff regulation, water
   conservation, landscape aesthetic, and engagement with nature. Thirdly,
   Hongcun reflects the concept of harmonious coexistence between human and
   nature, the wisdom of rational use of ecosystem structures, processes
   and functions, and the wisdom of coupling human activities with the
   living environment and natural ecosystem. Finally, the paper summarizes
   the enlightenment brought by both the HNIEP model and Hongcun wisdom to
   contemporary urban-rural planning and construction management.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>GeiBenklosterle Cave, located in the Ach Valley of the Swabian Alb and
   one of six Swabian cave sites recently named as a UNESCO World Heritage
   site, has a long history of archaeological research resulting in a
   detailed record of human occupation. Sometime around 45,000 years ago
   Neanderthals seemingly vanished from the Swabian landscape, and after a
   period of mostly geogenic deposit at GeiBenklosterle Cave we find
   deposits containing characteristically Aurignacian artifacts dating to
   as early as 42,500 years ago, These Aurignacian groups brought with them
   complex symbolic expression and communication including bone and ivory
   beads, musical instruments, and animal and human figurines. This study
   examines the climatic context of this depopulation through a taxonomic
   and taphonomic analysis of the rodent and insectivore remains associated
   with these periods and provides a relatively unbiased climatic record
   for the period of similar to 45,000-36,000 years ago in this region.
   Taphonomic analysis indicates that primarily the European eagle owl
   (Bubo bubo) and the kestrel (Falco tinnunculus) were responsible for
   accumulating the material, and allows us to quantify the potential
   taxonomic bias resulting from predator behaviour which includes a
   preference for voles, particularly the water vole (Arvicola terrestris).
   Additionally, rare taxa (which include species of murids and soricids)
   may have been present in greater quantities than our sample implies. The
   assemblage from GeiBenklosterle Cave is dominated by the field and
   common vole (Microtus arvalis/agrestis), the narrow-headed vole
   (Microtus gregalis), and the root/tundra vole (Microtus oeconomus).
   Overall, the Middle Paleolithic landscape included significant woodland
   and forested areas while a high proportion of species restricted to cold
   tundra environments likely indicate punctuated cold and arid periods.
   The signal from the nearly geogenic layer overlying the Middle
   Paleolithic material includes a moderate shift in the proportion of cold
   tundra adapted species, suggesting that the tundra expanded leading up
   to the Neanderthal depopulation, but no period of drastic climatic
   change is recognizable. The Aurignacian was significantly colder and
   drier than the preceding period, with cold tundra expansion reaching its
   apex (for the time period studied). Based on these results the Swabian
   landscape first encountered by Aurignacian groups was significantly less
   hospitable than that known to the earlier Middle Paleolithic
   populations. These results correlate well with past paleo-environmental
   reconstructions based on sedimentary, botanical, and faunal assemblages.
   There is no evidence in the small mammal record that climatic pressure
   drove Neanderthals from the Ach Valley, instead it seems likely they
   enjoyed a more temperate environment than later Aurignacian groups.
   Ongoing work focused on greater resolution of these climatic
   oscillations at similarly well-dated Swabian sites will shed further
   light on the timing and speed of this climatic shift and the response of
   the biological communities affected, including early human groups. (C)

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The concept of non-economic losses (NELs) has recently emerged in the
   context of negotiations on loss and damage under the United Nations
   Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). NELs are losses of
   values that are not commonly traded in markets but bear high relevance
   for those affected. Examples include loss of life, biodiversity and
   cultural heritage. The ongoing institutionalization of approaches to
   loss and damage under the UNFCCC offers great opportunities to provide a
   sound information base for policy- and decision-making on NELs.
   Available expertise to meet the emerging knowledge needs includes
   insights into relevant indicators, and adequate means of integrating
   NELs into decision-making processes that seek to reduce losses ex-ante.
   Further research is needed to identify or develop appropriate responses
   to NELs ex-post. Here, historical analogues of loss and practices of
   remembrance and recognition can provide valuable insights. Opportunities
   for engagement exist at the UNFCCC's science-policy interface. These
   include participation and active engagement at open meetings under the
   UNFCCC to advance exchange on applied research that is framed around
   policy- relevant questions on NELs as well as interaction with the
   expert group on NELs that was set up under the designated policy body to
   work on loss and damage under the UNFCCC, i.e. the Warsaw International
   Mechanism.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Trails are important elements in the natural and cultural landscape, and
   many ancient pathways have developed into routes of great significance
   for recreation and tourism in contemporary societies. By conducting a
   systematic quantitative literature review, this paper report on the
   status of international trail research and analyzes some of the key
   content with focus on trails for tourism and outdoor recreation in
   non-urban settings. For this purpose, we reviewed 195 research papers
   published in peer-reviewed academic journals. Results show that research
   on trails for tourism and outdoor recreation is primarily from
   English-speaking Western countries. The most studied trail-based
   activity is hiking, but there has been an increase in the number of
   studies researching multiple activities. Results also show that
   international trail research to a large extent is based on the natural
   sciences, and focus on environmental and managerial aspects of trail
   use. This review identifies gaps in trail research, especially in a
   socio-cultural context on topics such as heritage and public health.
   Research on conflicts between different recreational trail-based
   activities is also relatively scarce, as well as studies concerning
   conflicts between trail-based recreation interests and other land-use
   interests. We also identify a need for an exploration of the trail
   concept, as research has not yet articulated a clear definition of what
   a trail is. The paper also includes analyses of changes in trail-related
   research over time.</td>

   preservation of coastal cultural resources or cultural heritage. As a
   result, more research is needed to facilitate the design and
   implementation of feasible and transparent adaptation strategies for
   cultural resources under changing climate conditions. In this paper, we
   begin to explore the challenges and opportunities that face cultural
   resource managers as they begin to grapple with climate change
   adaptation planning in dynamic coastal environments. Specifically, we
   provide an overview of a value-focused, decision-analytic approach that
   was applied in a pilot test of climate adaptation planning for buildings
   within designated historic districts on the barrier islands of Cape
   Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina. We provide descriptions of
   the challenges that are uniquely facing cultural resource managers and
   initial evidence of the utility of this type of approach for informing
   judgments by presenting pre- and post-workshop survey data. Although
   additional research is critical to offer planning and policy guidance,
   we found that structured deliberations about cultural resource
   adaptation planning not only influenced participants' opinions but also
   provided a necessary space to better understand the complexities of
   climate and budget uncertainties. Our evaluation is a first step at
   documenting the difficult and value-laden decisions that must be
   addressed by cultural resource managers as fiscal constraints and
   impending climate impacts threaten the traditional approach of
   preservation in perpetuity.</td>

   pollution (SO2, HNO3, O-3, PM10) and meteorological conditions
   (temperature, precipitation, relative humidity) on limestone, copper and

   AMS-MINNI modelling system over the Italian territory over the time
   period 2003-2010. A comparison between high resolution data (AMS-MINNI
   grid, 4 x 4 km) and low resolution data (EMEP grid, 50 x 50 km) has been
   performed. Our results pointed out that the corrosion levels for
   limestone, copper and bronze are decreased in Italy from 2003 to 2010 in
   relation to decrease of pollutant concentrations. However, some problem
   related to air pollution persists especially in Northern and Southern
   Italy. In particular, PM10 and HNO3 are considered the main responsible
   for limestone corrosion. Moreover, the high resolution data (AMS-MINNI)
   allowed the identification of risk areas that are not visible with the
   low resolution data (EMEP modelling system) in all considered years and,
   especially, in the limestone case. Consequently, high resolution air
   quality simulations are suitable to provide concrete benefits in
   providing information for national effective policy against corrosion
   risk for cultural heritage, also in the context of climate changes that

   challenges of climate change and energy security. Smart city initiatives
   have arisen Europe-wide to help cities to start planning their future in
   a new way to become more sustainable and resilient. New business models
   need to be investigated to foster local business development, innovative
   local administrations and industries, valorize the cultural heritage and
   the research outcomes and promote community's participation. This
   transition is even more complex and necessary for sparsely populated
   regions with poor infrastructures in the buildings, manufacturing and
   transport domains and with a multi-layer local governance (e.g. Italian
   Towns, Provinces and Region). In this case, a widespread concept of
   smart city can be applied proposing systematic strategies for urban
   innovation with a regional-wide perspective. This paper focuses on a
   coordinated project aimed to promote smartness among local areas in a
   small region in Southern Italy (Basilicata). The Smart Basilicata'
   project constitutes a unique example in which, by working together,
   multi-layer public authorities, private enterprises, research
   organizations and universities drafted the basis for a regional strategy
   for smart-related issues.</td>

   become exposed, but also our land tangible cultural heritage will be
   submerged: entire nations and their cultural heritage may disappear,
   losing their identity. In fact, climate change has the potential to
   increase the sea level enough by 2100 to inundate 136 sites considered
   by UNESCO as cultural and historical treasures. However, climate change
   damage on cultural heritage is not only a warning as already it has
   caused damages to some cultural heritage. As a consequence, and although
   in the realm of archaeology preservation, in situ usually is the first
   option, climate change challenges the norm as it has an impact on
   cultural heritage. This study examines the specific climate changes that
   oceans will most likely suffer and how they will probably affect
   tangible cultural heritage. It also explores cases of heritage that
   already are suffering the consequences. Lastly, the article proposes a
   new partnership natural/cultural resources and the qualification of
   cultural heritage as a natural resource for its preservation,
   establishing the same common measures against climate change. (C) 2016

   changing world and require collaborative efforts for success.
   Conservation planning is the process of deciding how to protect,
   conserve, and enhance or minimize loss of natural and cultural
   resources. Establishing conservation targets (also called indicators or
   endpoints), the measurable expressions of desired resource conditions,
   can help with site-specific up to landscape-scale conservation planning.
   Using conservation targets and tracking them through time can deliver
   benefits such as insight into ecosystem health and providing early
   warnings about undesirable trends. We describe an approach using
   value-focused thinking to develop statewide conservation targets for
   Florida. Using such an approach allowed us to first identify stakeholder
   objectives and then define conservation targets to meet those
   objectives. Stakeholders were able to see how their shared efforts fit
   into the broader conservation context, and also anticipate the benefits
   of multi-agency and -organization collaboration. We developed an
   iterative process for large-scale conservation planning that included
   defining a shared framework for the process, defining the conservation
   targets themselves, as well as developing management and monitoring
   strategies for evaluation of their effectiveness. The process we
   describe is applicable to other geographies where multiple parties are
   seeking to implement collaborative, large-scale biological planning.

   questioning how best to contribute to multidisciplinary climate change
   knowledge. In this respect, much work is being undertaken within
   multidisciplinary conversations on adaptation and resilience. However,
   less attention has been paid to the other side of the climate change
   equation: mitigation. Furthermore, less emphasis has been placed on the
   translation of archaeological research to public understandings of
   climate change. Cultural heritage offers an analytical tool for bridging
   archaeological knowledge to the specific socio-political and ethical
   challenges facing communities today under global climate change. I
   suggest that cultural heritage can act as a proxy for transferring the
   archaeological record into the lived experiences of climate change for
   individuals and public actors. Moreover, in supporting experiences of
   change, cultural heritage also builds capacity for mobilizing social
   change, and therefore is well-suited to advocacy work seeking climate
   mitigation.</td>

   people construct place-based identities and understand their

   isolated 'deep rural' areas; from rapidly growing high amenity
   retirement and second home communities to dilapidated near-ghost towns;
   from those with strong economies in agriculture, natural resource
   extraction, tourism, and high tech to those with shrinking economies. In
   addition, such global issues as climate change, food security, and

   these circumstances planning thought and action are confronted - often
   simultaneously - with physical development -planning for growth and
   change; production - of traditional agricultural and natural resource
   outputs but also new outputs such as renewable energy and ecosystem
   services; and protection - of the natural environment, cultural
   resources, and social systems. This article draws from the literature
   and interviews of rural specialists to explore the current tensions
   between production, consumption, and protection and emerging responses
   to them, through an exploration of North American rural planning.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In the Netherlands awareness regarding the Urban Heat Island (UHI) was
   raised relatively recently. Because of this recent understanding, there
   is a lack of consistent urban micro-meteorological measurements to allow
   a conventional UHI assessment of Dutch cities during heat waves. This
   paper argues that it is possible to retrieve relevant UHI
   information-including adaptation guidelines-from satellite imagery.The
   paper comprises three parts. The first part consists of a study of
   suited indicators to identify urban heat islands from which a method is
   presented based on ground heat flux mapping. The second part proposes
   heat mitigation strategies and identifies the areas where these
   strategies could be applied within the hotspots identified in the cities
   of The Hague, Delft, Leiden, Gouda, Utrecht and Den Bosch. The third
   part estimates the reduction of urban heat generated by the increase of
   roof albedo in the hotspots of the six cities. The six cities hotspots
   are located within the boundaries of the seventeenth century city
   centres. In order to avoid interference with cultural values of these
   historical environments most likely UHI mitigation measures regard
   improving the thermal behaviour of the city roofs. For instance,
   applying white coatings on bitumen flat roofs (or replacing them by
   white singleply membranes) and replacing sloped roof clay tiles by
   coloured tiles with cool pigments can reduce the urban heat hotspots by
   approximately 1.5 degrees C.Remote sensing provides high level
   information that provide urban planners and policy makers with overall
   design guidelines for the reduction of urban heat.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The biodiversity of saline lakes is a topic of increasing interest among
   biologists, ecologists and conservation managers in East Africa. In
   spite of their extreme conditions and remote locations, East African
   saline lakes (EASL) support fish populations of considerable ecological,
   economic and biological importance. Among these are several endemic fish
   species that are highly specialized to survive in their individual
   lakes. Although there is growing concern that increasing human
   activities and projected adverse climatic conditions in the region may
   decimate these unique species, information on the status of individual
   fish populations remains scarce. In recognition of the important
   ecosystem services they provide, the EASL have been designated as World
   Heritage Sites (WHS) and protected by the Ramsar Convention. To
   complement these conservation efforts regarding EASL and to ensure full
   realization of the potential of their fisheries, there is need for
   up-to-date information on their fish population status. We present
   therefore an overview of the status of fish populations in EASL with
   special emphasis on the Magadi tilapia Alcolapia grahami, a teleost fish
   thriving in extreme hypersaline alkaline water conditions that would
   kill other fish in a matter of minutes. We show how several decades of
   research on this small cichlid fish inhabiting Lake Magadi, Kenya,
   reveal astonishing "snapshots" on how fish can survive under challenging
   environmental conditions, which, in this rare instance, are actually
   close to their physiological optima. As climatic models predict a
   decline in freshwater sources and an increment in adverse water
   conditions, studies on fish inhabiting saline lakes could aid scientists
   in modelling how species may evolve to adapt to extreme conditions in
   their changing habitats. We highlight conservation challenges facing the
   long-term existence of EASL fish populations. Finally, an integrated
   multidisciplinary approach is recommended to ensure the preservation and
   sustainable management of EASL fish populations and fisheries.</td>

   beauty of the continent and its wildlife but also because of the
   cultural and historical resources associated with the great explorers,
   such as Shackleton. This article examines the interplay and
   interrelationships between natural and cultural heritage resources and
   how this may shape the Antarctic experience and the benefits and
   outcomes associated with tourism participation. In particular we
   examined how tourist's perspectives on climate change are influenced
   through this interplay between natural and cultural heritage resources.
   Data were drawn from participant observation, field notes, and
   open-ended questionnaires that were distributed to tourists that
   participated in four different Antarctic voyages in 2014. The study
   finds that cultural heritage resources, such as historic sites and
   locations, could be used as a narrative vehicle for discussing broader
   enivronmental issues such as climate change, as tourists appear willing
   to consider cultural and natural environments as existing in a
   symbiotic, rather than a dichotomous relationship. However, interpreters
   and guides may need to make the connections between cultural heritage
   resources and climate change more overt, as tourists did not necessarily
   view environmental issues through the prism of cultural heritage.</td>

   the total stock (21% in the UK) and must therefore contribute
   significantly to any long-term energy reduction or carbon saving goal.
   However, the principle of minimal intervention advocated by heritage
   conservationists is at odds with the fabric-first approach that energy
   conservationists propound. It is clear, therefore, that a different
   approach is needed to ensure significant savings are still delivered by
   the historic stock whilst balancing the need to maintain our built
   heritage.In this paper, we raise the question of whether the price of
   altering the built historic environment is worth the contribution such
   measures could make to meet the overarching and serious challenge of
   climate change. We focus the work on the potential for roof mounted
   Photo Voltaic (PV) installations, by taking a case study approach. The
   research examines S case studies in and around the UNESCO World Heritage
   city of Bath in the South West of the UK. The generation pattern of the
   PV systems is compared to electricity demand in the dwelling to assess
   the potential for maximising the use of PV electricity and minimising
   domestic CO2 emissions.Results indicate that in ordinary energy use
   patterns, without additional demand management, an average of 56% of
   electricity generated from a roof mounted PV system is used within the
   dwelling, reducing CO2 emissions by an average of 19%. In contrast,
   typical actual savings from changes to the building fabric, which are
   difficult to implement and often not realised in practice, are around
   9%. Results also show that where energy use patterns are arranged to
   synchronise with PV electricity generation, reductions of up to 23% can
   be made in CO2 emissions arising from delivered electricity use. (C)

   Pacific in relationship to each other in contexts of climate change and
   investment in extractive industry. The paper explores the interactions
   between extractive industry, climate change and environmental governance
   through the lenses of double exposure, double movements, resilience and
   risk. The first part of the paper addresses the nature and scope of
   investments in extractive industries in this other Pacific'. The
   geography of these investments is changing the actual and perceived
   distribution of exposure and risk in the region. The nature of this risk
   is also being affected by climate change and its implications for the
   geographies of water and land-use. Much of the contention surrounding
   extractive industries can be understood as conflicts over the unequal
   distribution of this risk, how to interpret its significance and the
   ways in which resilience might be enhanced to respond to it. The final
   section of the paper discusses the ways in which mining governance and
   governance for resilience converge and, on the basis of recent
   experiences in El Salvador, analyses the difficulties in governing
   extractive industry in a way that manages risk and builds resilience.</td>

   its subsequent impact on climate change has led some to recommend strict
   measures to reduce the volume of travel. While the reduction of
   tourism's GHG emissions is an essential piece of tourism's
   sustainability, there has been little discussion of the implications
   that reducing travel could have on a destination's triple bottom line
   (ecological, sociocultural, and economic sustainability). Much of the
   sustainable tourism literature has historically focused on maximizing
   tourism's benefits to residents' quality of life, the environment,
   cultural heritage, and the economy, but these traditional metrics have
   been largely removed from the recent discussion on tourism and climate
   change. This article proposes a conceptual model that incorporates the
   traditional metrics of sustainability with the net amount of GHG emitted
   to help determine whether travel has a net positive or negative impact.
   While the model is entirely theoretical, it depicts sustainable tourism
   as not solely a function of GHG emissions, but a function of maximizing
   tourism's positive impacts (handprint) within destinations while
   minimizing its GHG emissions (footprint). The article concludes by
   demonstrating how the framework can be applied to increase tourism's
   sustainability within destinations as well as globally.</td>

   construction sector has a great potential for energy savings and
   environmental impact reduction. Nearly two-thirds of French buildings
   were built without any existing thermal regulation: thermal renovation
   of these buildings is a priority. However, some of these buildings are
   classified as " historical heritage remarkable architecture"; this
   strong constraint does not allow the use of traditional renovation
   methods. This study aims to characterize the thermal behavior of a
   double window. A numerical thermal model is developed taking into
   account the heat and mass transfer in the double window. A specific
   experimental platform has also been designed and built to experimentally
   characterize the behavior of the double window and to validate the
   developed numerical model. A simulation protocol was then defined and
   implemented in order to outline the key parameters and therefore make
   recommendations for double window implementation and their design.The
   numerical and experimental results were used to characterize the
   influence of the thickness of the air gap of the double window, the
   thermal inertia of the facade and the ventilation strategies. (C) 2015

   observed that imply effects of climate change on ecosystems, such as
   decreases in seasonal sea ice, changes in fishing grounds, and the
   appearance of non-local species. This study summarizes observed and
   anticipated effects of such climate change on fisheries in the heritage
   area and discusses policy and research needs for adapting to these
   changes. International research and monitoring at the scale of large
   marine ecosystems (LMEs) is the basis of all policy measures for
   adapting to climate change. Several measures need to be combined, taking
   into account the various socio-ecological aspects of fisheries and
   scales of ecosystems. Such measures of adaptation should be incorporated
   also into the cross-sector coordination system and the Integrated
   Management Plan, which were established to manage the World Heritage
   area. Also, culture is an important part of society, and the World
   Heritage programme may offer clues for creating a new and peaceful

   awareness and engagement; leading by example; and action on the
   ground.The management of terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems should
   focus on the restoration and maintenance of ecosystems, natural
   processes, biodiversity and abiotic processes, forms and environments
   that are free of significant impacts from local or regional threats to
   ecological integrity, cultural resources and human health. Ideally,
   protected areas should be nested within ecological regions that are
   permeable for the movement of native species and that contain sufficient
   habitat for the self-perpetuation of native wildlife populations. Fast
   and slow migrant native species should be managed to permit orderly
   ecological shifts that favour the maintenance of high biodiversity.
   Alien species should be managed to minimize their presence. The
   management of marine ecosystems should focus on the conservation of
   biotic resources and sustainable resource use, also free from
   significant local and regional threats to wild populations and human
   health.Conversely, parks should neither be manipulated to sequester
   carbon or to buffer against natural disasters, nor be moved in pursuit
   of migrating or future ecoregions. Where natural regions guide park
   establishment, they should not be recast wholesale in anticipation of

   lends itself to being deployed in visual communication strategies

   However, growing impacts of climate change are of the utmost concern for
   the integrity of many sites. Here, we inventory the glaciers present in
   natural World Heritage sites for the first time. We found 19,000
   glaciers in 46 sites located all over the world. We analyze their recent
   evolution, current state, and project their mass change over the 21st
   century. Our results are based on a comprehensive review of the
   literature as well as a state-of-the-art glaciological model for
   computing glacier responses up to 2100. Illustrating the strong
   influence of CO2 emission scenarios and human actions on future ice loss
   magnitude, we project the wastage of 33% to 60% of the 2017 cumulative
   ice volume of 12,000 km(3) of World Heritage glaciers by 2100.
   Furthermore, we expect complete glacier extinction in 8 to 21 of the
   investigated World Heritage sites until the end of the century,
   depending on the climate scenario. We suggest that World Heritage
   glaciers should be considered as analogs to endangered umbrella,
   keystone, and flagship species, whose conservation would secure wider

   losses, material damages, and societal consequences. Quantifying related
   risks is, therefore, an important societal task, particularly in view of
   future climate change. For this task, climate risk assessment
   increasingly uses model chains, which mainly build on data from the last
   few decades. The past record of events could play a role in this
   context. New numerical techniques can make use of historical weather
   data to simulate impacts quantitatively. However, using historical data
   for model applications differs from using recent products. Here, we
   provide an overview of climate risk assessment methodologies and of the
   properties of historical instrumental and documentary data. Using three
   examples, we then outline how historical environmental data can be used
   today in climate risk assessment by (1) developing and validating
   numerical model chains, (2) providing a large statistical sample which
   can be directly exploited to estimate hazards and to model present
   risks, and (3) establishing "worst-case" events which are relevant
   references in the present or future. The examples show that, in order to
   be successful, different sources (reanalyses, digitized instrumental
   data, and documentary data) and methods (dynamical downscaling and

   threats facing archaeological sites, at both current and future
   timescales. Siraf, on the Persian Gulf of Iran, is a site of national
   and international importance whose history stretches back to the
   Sassanid period (224-652 AD). In the present context of global change
   (drought and relative sea-level rise) and anthropogenic impacts (coastal
   artificialization and reduced sediment supply), the city's waterfront
   archaeology is undergoing significant erosion. Nonetheless, at present,
   the processes leading to the loss of Sirafs in situ archaeological
   remains are still poorly understood, including the rates, timing and
   drivers of coastal erosion. Here we use Landsat images to monitor
   shoreline changes along the Siraf coastline between 1973 and 2016. We
   spatially quantify the causes and impacts of surface changes along 244
   transects. The results demonstrate that coastal erosion is responsible
   for widespread and archaeologically significant damage, with 48% of the
   studied transects showing erosion during the period 1973-2016. We
   elucidate significant temporal variations in the data and, most notably,
   demonstrate that continued drought since the early 2000s has impacted
   upon sediment supply to coastal areas, severely accentuating erosion.
   For instance, between 2003 and 2016, 70% of transects recorded shoreline
   retreat with worrying implications for the waterfront archaeology of
   Siraf. These quantitative results provide invaluable spatial information
   regarding the causes and impacts of erosion upon Sirafs waterfront
   heritage, in addition to furnishing a template for the protection of the
   city's internationally important cultural heritage.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Early developmental stages of fishes are particularly sensitive to
   changes in environmental variables that affect physiological processes
   such as metabolism and growth. Both temperature and food availability
   have significant effects on the growth and survival of larval and
   juvenile fishes. As climate change and anthropogenic disturbances
   influence sensitive rearing environments of fishes it is unlikely that
   they will experience changes in temperature or food availability in
   isolation. Therefore, it is critical that we determine the effects of
   each of these potential stressors on larval growth and development, as
   well as understand the additive, synergistic or antagonistic effects of
   both. We reared threatened green sturgeon Acipenser medirostris (initial
   age ca. 32 days post hatch) at four temperatures (11, 13, 16 and 19
   degrees C) and two food availability rates (100% and 40% of optimal) to
   assess the effects of these stressors and their interactions on larval
   growth. We compared the overall size (fork length, total length and
   mass), growth rates (cm day(-1) and g day(-1)) and relative condition
   factor of these larval and juvenile fish at 3 week intervals for up to
   12 weeks. Our results indicated that temperature and food availability
   both had significant effects on growth and condition and that there was
   a significant interaction between the two. Fish reared with limited food
   availability exhibited similar patterns in growth rates to those reared
   with elevated food rates, but the effects of temperature were greatly
   attenuated when fish were food-limited. Also, the effects of temperature
   on condition were reversed when fish were reared with restricted food,
   such that fish reared at 19 degrees C exhibited the highest relative
   condition when fed optimally, but the lowest relative condition when
   food was limited. These data are critical for the development of
   relevant bioenergetics models, which are needed to link the survival of
   larval sturgeons with historic environmental regimes, pinpoint
   temperature ranges for optimal survival and help target future
   restoration sites that will be important for the recovery of sturgeon
   populations.</td>

   Europe have been dendrochronologically dated in recent decades. We use
   the annually precise evidence from a unique dataset of 49 640 tree
   felling dates of historical constructions to reconstruct temporal
   changes in building activity between 1250 and 1699 CE across a large
   part of western and central Europe largely corresponding to the former
   Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. Comparison with annual records
   of 9772 plague outbreaks shows that construction activity was
   significantly negatively correlated to the number of plague outbreaks,
   with the greatest decrease in construction following the larger
   outbreaks by three to four years after the start of the epidemics.
   Preceding the Black Death (1346-1353 CE) by five decades and the Great
   Famine (1315-1322 CE) by two decades, a significant decline in
   construction activity at c. 1300 CE is indicative of a societal crisis,
   associated with population stagnation or decline. Another dramatic
   decline in building activity coincides with the Thirty Years' War
   (1618-1648 CE) and confirms the devastating nature of this conflict.
   While construction activity was significantly lower during periods of
   high grain prices, no statistically robust relationship between the
   number of felling dates and past temperature or hydroclimate variations
   is found. This study demonstrates the value of dendrochronological
   felling dates as an indicator for times of crisis and prosperity during
   periods when documentary evidence is limited.</td>

   objects. Objects housed in historic buildings are at risk because the
   indoor environments in these buildings are difficult to control and
   often influenced by the outdoor climate. Hygroscopic materials, such as
   wood, will gain and release moisture during changes in relative humidity
   and temperature. These changes cause swelling and shrinkage, which may
   result in permanent damage. To increase the knowledge of climate-induced
   damage to heritage objects, it is essential to monitor moisture
   transport in wood. Simulation models need to be developed and improved
   to predict the influence of climate change. In a previous work, relative
   humidity and temperature was monitored at different depths inside wooden
   samples subjected to fluctuating climate over time. In this article, two
   methods, the hygrothermal building simulation software WUFI (R) Pro and
   the Simplified model, were compared in relation to the measured data.
   The conclusion was that both methods can simulate moisture diffusion and
   transport in wooden object with a sufficient accuracy. Using the two
   methods for predicted climate change data show that the mean RH inside
   wood is rather constant, but the RH minimum and maximum vary with the
   predicted scenario and the type of building used for the simulation.</td>

   the community-weighted mean (CWM-LT50) and its functional diversity
   (FD-LT50). Plots were stratified according to distance to rabbit
   shelters and latrines as a proxy for rabbit density, proximity to Stipa
   tenacissima and spring water availability, where annual species
   abundance was recorded in all plots over three consecutive years.Key
   Results Annual species were able to resist a threshold temperature of -4
   degrees C and most had LT50 values around the absolute minimum
   temperature (-9.5 degrees C) in the three years. Higher rabbit densities
   led to lower CWM-LT50 and higher FD-LT50 values. Plots close to Stipa
   tussocks had higher CWM-LT50 values whereas water availability had no
   effects.Conclusions High freezing resistance was extended among winter
   annual species, suggesting the presence of an association between
   historical environmental filtering and low winter temperatures. However,
   the community functional structure related to freezing resistance
   remained variable among scenarios with differences in herbivory pressure
   and distance to perennial vegetation. The trends observed indicate that
   traits that allow plants to deal with herbivory may also promote
   freezing resistance, and that tussocks can act as nurses via
   microclimatic amelioration of harsher winter conditions.</td>

   50,000 years. During 50-25 ka BP, a cool period featuring
   stadial-interstadial fluctuations, arbuscular mycorrhizal and

   interval, the representation of ectomycorrhizal, non-mycorrhizal and
   facultatively mycorrhizal plants increased, while that of N-fixing
   plants decreased further. From 15 ka BP, which marks the transition to
   and establishment of the Holocene interglaciation, representation of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal plants decreased further, while that of
   ectomycorrhizal, non-mycorrhizal, N-fixing and wind-pollinated plants
   increased. These changes in the mutualist trait structure of vegetation
   may reflect responses to historical environmental conditions that are

   visual studies. This paper assesses the usefulness of climate change
   films in light of ongoing debates in science communication and climate
   change communication about the best-known and, most popular movies.
   Using a handful of English-language films as a sample, the paper asks
   how the usefulness of climate change films is to be determined if not by
   sole reference to the accuracy or truthfulness of factual information.
   The paper demonstrates that all types of film's (from award-winning
   science documentaries to Hollywood blockbusters) have been debated and
   critiqued, especially in regard to scientific verisimilitude and image
   integrity. Usefulness is therefore not a matter of film type. Nor is it
   simply a matter of accuracy, because films containing inaccuracies have
   their supporters as well. The paper evaluates usefulness in terms of the
   work that climate change films do and the methods they use. I argue that
   the two key criteria for determining usefulness are teachability and
   integrity. In conclusion, I reinforce calls to detach the issue of
   usefulness from accurate science per se. Useful films are educative,
   truthful and trustworthy, in ways not always intended by filmmakers.</td>

   climate change, perhaps two to three times faster than other areas of

   no longer offers sufficient protection from expanding human use and
   development for its rich and diverse natural and cultural heritage.
   While considerable attention is being focused on better understanding
   and more effectively protecting its natural resources, far less is being
   done to identify and preserve this region's significant maritime
   heritage resources. This remoteness and inaccessibility that has
   protected Arctic resources for so long has also constrained our capacity
   to conduct sufficient archaeological studies to inform and guide the
   place-specific identification and preservation of what remains of this
   compelling history and heritage. The wilderness landscape of the Arctic
   has a rich and relatively well-documented historical record, spanning
   more than 2000 years of exploration and commerce, and of Indigenous
   cultures stretching further back over 4000-6000 years. More effectively
   using this historical record to identify significant maritime cultural
   landscapes in the Arctic and expanding the use of precautionary
   approaches to the preservation of these landscapes will not only assist
   in establishing regional priorities for targeted archaeological surveys

   envision and adjust to alternative futures. There is a need for more
   studies on the social basis for climate change asking why people hold
   the attitudes they do, rather than the dominant tendency to ask how to
   change attitudes and behavior. Research in different fields show that
   fundamental life values and worldviews are shaped through life and
   heavily influenced by early life socialization and culture, which in
   turn can shape attitudes toward specific phenomena like climate change.
   We surveyed a representative sample of the Norwegian public and examined
   how cultural resources and trust in environmental governance
   institutions are related to attitudes toward climate change. High levels
   of trust are associated with a tendency to perceive climate change as
   human caused, and low levels of trust correspond with stronger beliefs
   that climate change are natural phenomena. High levels of cultural
   resources are found among climate change deniers as well as believers,
   indicating that groups with different political, professional and
   intellectual orientations, as well as life histories, may not trust
   climate change science. We argue that improved knowledge about the
   social basis for climate change is an imperative part of
   futures-oriented expertise.</td>

   Mountains between Sweden and Norway, and the low-mountain regions of
   northern Norway, Sweden and Finland, and the adjacent northwestern
   Russia. Regionally, these forests are differentiated into spruce, pine
   or birch dominance due to climatic differences. Variation in tree
   species dominance within these regions is generally caused by a
   combination of historical and prevailing disturbance regimes, including
   both chronic and episodic disturbances, their magnitude and frequency,
   as well as differences in edaphic conditions and topography. Because of
   their remoteness, slow growth and restrictions of use, these mountain
   forests are generally less affected by human utilization than more
   productive and easily utilizable forests at lower elevations and/or
   latitudes. As a consequence, these northern forests of Europe are often
   referred to as Europes last wilderness, even if human influence of
   varying intensity has been ubiquitous through historical time. Because
   of their naturalness, the North Fennoscandian mountain forests are of
   paramount importance for biodiversity conservation, monitoring of
   ecosystem change and for their sociocultural values. As such, they also
   provide unique reference areas for basic and applied research, and for
   developing methods of forest conservation, restoration and
   ecosystem-based management for the entire Fennoscandia. However, the
   current rapid change in climate is predicted to profoundly affect the
   ecology and dynamics of these forests in the future. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   can be particularly acute when such development occurs in the vicinity
   of World Heritage sites. A key example is the Great Barrier Reef World
   Heritage Area (GBRWHA) in northeastern Australia, where a 2012 review by
   the World Heritage Council found that rapid port development inshore of
   the coral reef posed significant risks to local marine ecosystems. Such
   instances pose pressing challenges for decision-makers seeking to manage
   World Heritage sites for multiple values and needs, including those of
   key stakeholder groups, such as local communities. There is increasingly
   a societal expectation that public decision-making takes into account
   local views and priorities, and that companies seek a social license to
   operate'. This research explored local community attitudes toward port
   development associated with the export of liquefied natural gas (LNG)
   and coal through the GBRWHA. Using data drawn from a survey and
   interviews, the research examined how a range of geographical factors,
   including proximity to gas infrastructure and the perceived impacts and
   risks of development to the local community, economy and environment
   shape community perceptions of the industry. Findings suggest that local
   attitudes toward gas and coal terminal development inshore of the GBRWHA
   are shaped predominantly by community perceptions of environmental
   impacts and risks associated with such infrastructure, in contrast to a
   broader public narrative that focuses largely on economic benefits. A
   complex combination of other factors, including social impacts, personal
   environmental values, community trust in industry, and equity in
   decision-making and distribution of the risks and benefits of industrial
   development also contribute. Placed in a broader, global context, the
   findings have important implications for public decision-making
   processes in Australia and elsewhere as they suggest that, for local
   communities, the perceived impacts of gas development on the environment
   may overshadow the benefits of industry.</td>

   tagged as the 'greatest reef in the world', the 'best managed reef' and
   potentially a 'world heritage site in danger'. Combining research in
   conservation psychology, place identity and visual communication, this
   study analysed a sample of images (n = 45) of the Great Barrier Reef to
   explore the complexity of messages being conveyed with regard to the
   status and health of the world heritage site and their impact on
   emotions and behavioural intentions of potential tourists (n = 1249).
   The results reveal three very different image types: tourism promotion,
   government support and conservation-oriented. Few of the images portray
   messaging underpinned by the science of conservation psychology, with
   most images portraying a negative or ambivalent message. The emotions
   elicited by the images significantly differed across the three different
   image types, resulting in different behavioural intentions in response.
   The overall finding is that there are often contradictory messages about
   the Reef, arguably impeding conservation efforts to protect the Reef,
   and a need for an integrated place identity management communication
   strategy. We propose the notion of care as one value that drives all
   three major stakeholders and that could underpin an integrated strategy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper examines the potential for multiple co-benefits to arise
   through re-establishing the connection between Aboriginal people and
   their lands. The research project was participatory in its design and
   implementation, and centred on three short but intensive visits to the
   Kendall River over a period of 4 years. Interviews with and observations
   of Kendall River people on country provided qualitative information
   concerning their wish to reconnect with country, not only to transmit
   key cultural knowledge through the generations, re-socialise their lands
   and manage them appropriately but also to help them manage the negative
   consequences of Wik aggregation in the troubled community of Aurukun.
   Participants reported that returning to and carrying out activities on
   country, and the family and country planning resulting from those trips,
   provided a way to counter feelings of disempowerment and despondency
   arising from living solely in Aurukun. This paper concludes by arguing
   that activities that re-engage Aboriginal people with country (if not
   actually returning to live on country) can serve to build cultural
   resilience in the face of multiple economic, environmental and social
   challenges, including those arising from life lived largely in
   communities such as Aurukun, thereby also likely benefiting their
   physical and psychosocial health and well-being.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Freshwater lakes are an important natural and cultural resource in
   national parks across the USA. At Cape Cod National Seashore, in
   southeastern Massachusetts, the water quality of these water bodies
   (known as kettle ponds), along with local precipitation chemistry, has
   been measured since the 1980s. These datasets, along with air
   temperature obtained from a local weather station, were analyzed to
   assess temporal trends in the air temperature, precipitation acidity,
   pond temperature, and pond pH, and are interpreted within the context of
   regional air quality improvements and increasing temperatures from
   regional climate warming. The results suggest that all parameters have
   increased significantly during the last several decades. As temperature
   and pH regulate a wide variety of physical, chemical, and biological
   processes, these changes may be influencing the overall ecology of the
   kettle ponds. This analysis provides an opportunity to gauge the future
   trajectory of this important resource and may ultimately guide
   management strategies for their continued protection against a backdrop
   of climate change and atmospheric emission controls.</td>

   regional scales is a fundamental step for designing successful long-term
   coastal management plans. This study was thus designed to assess Kuwait
   coastal vulnerability to SLR at four scenarios (.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 m).
   Potential inundated areas and the number of people at risk were
   estimated based on these SLR scenarios. A coastal vulnerability index
   (CVI) map of Kuwait was then computed based on the lowest scenario using
   eight parameters: elevation, coastal slope, geomorphology, distance to
   20-m isobath, population, land use, cultural heritage and
   transportation. The geographic distribution of inundated areas at an SLR
   of .5 m revealed that the northern islands of Kuwait and coastal areas
   along Kuwait Bay would be highly impacted, whereas the coastal area near
   Shuaibah Port was the most influenced among the southern coasts. Most of
   the coastal area exhibited a moderate vulnerability to SLR, especially
   the northern islands. This study presented an initial vulnerability
   assessment for Kuwait coasts to SLR, which can be extended with more
   variables. The integrated remote sensing and geographic information
   system methodology demonstrated in this study can be applied in similar
   studies elsewhere.</td>

   development and the imaginative and spiritual vitality of humanity. They
   are part of our collective identity", as it is internationally defined
   and accepted (ICOMOS-UNESCO). The need for their protection, management
   and inclusion in the territorial policies has already been widely
   accepted and pursued. There is a great number of risks to which the
   cultural landscapes are exposed, arising mainly from natural (both due
   to slow geo-physical phenomena as well as hazards) and anthropogenic
   causes (e.g. urbanisation pressure, agriculture, landscape fragmentation
   etc.). This paper explores to what extent Earth Observation (EO)
   technologies can contribute to identify and evaluate the risks to which
   Cultural Landscapes of Cyprus are exposed, taking into consideration
   specific phenomena, such as land movements and soil erosion. The
   research of the paper is illustrated as part of the activities carried
   out in the CLIMA project - "Cultural Landscape risk Identification,
   Management and Assessment". It aims to combine the fields of remote
   sensing technologies, including Sentinel data, and monitoring of
   cultural landscape for its improved protection and management. Part of
   this approach will be based on the use of InSAR techniques in order to
   monitor the temporal evolution of deformations through the detection and
   measurement of the effects of surface movements caused by various
   factors. The case study selected for Cyprus is the Nea Paphos
   archeological site and historical center of Paphos, which are listed as
   UNESCO World Heritage sites. The interdisciplinary approach adopted in
   this research was useful to identify major risks affecting the landscape
   of Cyprus and to classify the most suitable EO methods to assess and map
   such risks.</td>

   sustainability of tourism, including heritage tourism. Yet, despite
   growth in literature on climate change and heritage, there is little
   specific literature on the relationship between climate change and
   heritage tourism. The paper introduces a special issue on heritage
   tourism and climate change. It briefly outlines the future challenges of
   climate change before commenting on tourism's role in climate change and
   the challenge of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Using UNWTO tourism
   estimates, a tentative figure of half of all emissions of tourism could
   be ascribed to heritage-related tourism.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>This paper is focused on the importance and influence of the innovations
   in the time of the fourth industry revolution for the creation of value
   added in tourism industry. Innovative technology solutions solve
   problems in a tourist destination, as in the case of the effects of
   climate change as well as the revival of cultural heritage. New products
   that are connected with the Internet (e.g. Internet of things) and
   digital solution services invites small and medium sized firms, and
   other relevant actors, to apply for funding of co-operative tourism
   innovation projects. The proposals should primarily focus on the
   development of innovative products, services and concepts to accelerate
   the tourism sector. Innovative products and services form the framework
   of marketing efforts to encourage consumers to decide for the purchase
   and thus affect the sales success of tourist firms. Innovations that are
   intended to satisfy the wishes and needs of consumers, based on existing
   knowledge. Usually it is a technological innovation with features that
   provide additional solutions compared with the existing ones. Firms want
   to attract customers who have different needs from the existing
   customers. The contribution of the paper is mainly conceptual. With the
   development of the digital innovations (web 2.0., web 3.0., internet,
   the internet of things) that is central to the new industrial
   revolution, has led to "Industry 4.0" in tourism. The aim of this paper
   is to provide answers to RQ1: To present the known theory and practices
   of innovations in tourism; RQ2: To investigate the changes that will
   result from Industry 4.0 in tourism.</td>

   of increasingly detailed, elaborate and complex climate change impact
   assessments. It is a challenge to determine how, when and by whom
   climate predictions should be translated into risk estimates usable for
   decision-making. In this paper results from the Climate for Culture
   project are used to study how heritage decision-makers interpret future
   indoor climate-related risks to Swedish churches. Different sets of risk
   maps were presented to ten engineers, ten building conservators and five
   experts on indoor climate related risks. Interviews were used to
   understand how the interviewees made sense of the presented information
   and if they associated it with a perceived need for adaptation. The
   results show that the risks were interpreted and assessed largely
   dependent on their pre-understanding and familiarity with the individual
   risks. The magnitude of change and the lack of uncertainty estimates
   were subordinate to the overall impression of the information as being
   credible and salient. The major conclusion is that the dissemination of
   risk information, also from projects which at the outset have aimed at
   producing knowledge relevant for end-users, should be both customized
   and tested in collaborative efforts by stakeholders and scientists. (C)

   frequent extreme weather events, changing temperatures, rising sea
   levels, and impacts we cannot entirely anticipate, suggests that current
   approaches to historic preservation will need to be adapted in order to
   continue to protect our cultural heritage with the same level of care
   that we expect today. In attempting to anticipate the needs of a
   constantly changing future, preservationists need to plan for a range of
   eventualities, consider new strategies, and determine how these
   strategies can be tested. Interestingly, appropriate adaptive strategies
   may exist in past cultural responses to harsh and shifting environments,
   like our coastal areas and barrier islands. One such historic coastal
   community, which represents the unique type of heritage and sense of
   place that preservationists work to protect and is currently at risk due
   to sea level rise, is Portsmouth Village on the Outer Banks of North
   Carolina. The particular responses and adaptations to a challenging and
   ever-changing environment, which were developed and adopted by residents
   of Portsmouth Village to address environmental forces, offer some clues
   for possible future responses to climate change. This paper examines
   historical approaches and potential future strategies for the
   preservation of cultural landscapes and other heritage resources
   threatened by climate change.</td>

   traditional craftsmanship, a domain of intangible cultural heritage. The
   UNESCO has regularly pointed out the challenges created by
   globalization, including lengthy apprenticeships with low remuneration,
   mass-production of goods needed for daily life, environmental and
   climate change pressures, changing social conditions and cultural
   tastes, etc. The effects of these challenges are most noticeable when it
   comes to small indigenous groups, for whom they can have an adverse
   impact. Arunachal Pradesh is a hill state of India inhabited by 31
   indigenous groups. This makes Arunachal Pradesh a suitable site for
   studying the effects of these challenges. Household objects are one of
   the numerous expressions of traditional craftsmanship, which have been
   subjected to the changing influences of globalization within a
   relatively short period of time. The domestic articles of an average
   ethnic house of Arunachal Pradesh are usually made of cane and bamboo.
   The primary focus of this article is to evaluate the effects of the
   challenges posed by globalization, as mentioned by UNESCO, on the
   household objects of the Nyishi group, one of the 31 indigenous groups
   of Arunachal Pradesh. They are traditionally expert in making their
   household objects with cane and bamboo. The case study was conducted at
   Seijosa, a locality mainly inhabited by the Nyishis of East Kameng
   district of Arunachal Pradesh. Based on the unstructured and open ended
   interviews, this case study focused on the traditional craftsmen's
   perspective and observations about the changes on traditional cane and
   bamboo household objects of Nyishi community, as they are regularly
   involved in making and distributing these products. The findings of the
   case study indicate that almost all the challenges, mentioned by UNESCO,
   are noticeable on the traditional craftsmanship of cane and bamboo
   household materials of Nyishi group.</td>

   examines the influence of climate change on people and fish in the
   Yakima River Basin, USA. Jenni et al. (2013) addresses
   stakeholder-relevant climate change issues, such as water availability
   and uncertainty, with decision analysis tools. Montag et al. (2014)
   explores Yakama Tribal cultural values and well-being and their
   incorporation into the decision-making process. Graves and Maule (2012)
   simulates effects of climate change on stream temperatures under
   baseline conditions (1981-2005) and two future climate scenarios
   (increased air temperature of 1 A degrees C and 2 A degrees C). Hardiman
   and Mesa (2013) looks at the effects of increased stream temperatures on
   juvenile steelhead growth with a bioenergetics model. Finally, Hatten et
   al. (2013) examines how changes in stream flow will affect salmonids
   with a rule-based fish habitat model. Our simulations indicate that
   future summer will be a very challenging season for salmonids when low
   flows and high water temperatures can restrict movement, inhibit or
   alter growth, and decrease habitat. While some of our simulations
   indicate salmonids may benefit from warmer water temperatures and
   increased winter flows, the majority of simulations produced less
   habitat. The floodplain and tributary habitats we sampled are
   representative of the larger landscape, so it is likely that climate
   change will reduce salmonid habitat potential throughout particular
   areas of the basin. Management strategies are needed to minimize
   potential salmonid habitat bottlenecks that may result from climate
   change, such as keeping streams cool through riparian protection, stream
   restoration, and the reduction of water diversions. An investment in
   decision analysis and support technologies can help managers understand
   tradeoffs under different climate scenarios and possibly improve water
   and fish conservation over the next century.</td>

   cultural heritage. Through a careful analysis of ash salts and
   salt-making and the technologies and bodily affects associated with it,
   the authors suggest native Amazonian peoples see environmental knowledge
   not in terms of natural resources but instead how they interact with and
   produce human bodies in social networks, as a form of sexual education
   and, by extension, public health. It also highlights the critical
   importance of social relations as part of research, and the politics of
   nature, with important implications for contemporary debate and research
   on biodiversity, sustainability, climate change and human rights,
   specifically what types of agreements are entailed in scientific
   research that is not only robust but socially responsible.</td>

   grounds often stand for many years. Stable grounds are not always stable
   for ever in the face of weathering of rocks, toe erosion of the slope by
   rivers, climate change, earthquakes, and possible human activities. It
   is the frontier of research in Landslide Science to evaluate the risk of
   slopes which have been stable for more than 500-1000 years. It is very
   similar to earthquake risk evaluation and the preparedness for
   earthquakes along active faults such as the 2008 Sichuan (Wenchuan)
   earthquake in China. Such long-term risk evaluation addresses social and
   scientific research needs. This paper briefly introduces the successful
   lesson learnt for landslide risk evaluation and preparedness in the Tang
   Dynasty (618-907) Imperial Resort Palace in Xian, China for risk
   evaluation and preparedness of Precursor Stage of Landslides before
   failure, and then describes the landslide risk evaluation in Inca's

   concerning understanding of the relation between social and

   emphasized. Several important general social issues characteristic for
   countries of SEE (geographic position, level of economic development and
   cooperation, historical heritage, state of awareness of the public
   concerning specific social questions, relation with the EU) as basic
   factors which influence understanding of general frameworks of security
   in this region have been underlined. A special attention is paid to the
   state of the environment and its relevance for security in SEE. Within
   this context, an assessment is provided and critical elements in the
   fields of nature protection, biodiversity, waste management, water
   management, agriculture, energy, transport, harmonization of national
   regulations with those of the EU are pinpointed. The central thesis is
   that the specific combinations of social, economic and environmental
   characteristics of countries of the region are causing (or can cause)
   serious instability and threaten security. The low level of mutual
   cooperation between the countries of the region is another particularly
   unfavourable circumstance influencing security of the region.</td>

   Therefore, the tourism target should be divided into conference, rural,

   Thus, the investment incentives for green-field investments and other

   the success of these policies are to remove price distortions, decrease

   providing fundamental ecosystem services to human well-being,
   vicissitudes imposed by deforestation, climate change, widespread use of
   fire and development of new infrastructure make the region critically
   vulnerable to the consequences of the creation of new forest edges. In
   this forest fragmentation scenario, temporal assessment of edge effects
   influences throughout the life of the trees become necessary for a
   better understanding of how species are affected and react when exposed
   to altered environments. In this study, we evaluated the temporal
   influence of the edge effect on the growth dynamics of Scleronema
   micranthum (Ducke) Ducke by tree-ring analysis based on basal area
   increment and release events. This species is one of the most frequent
   tree species of terra firme type of forest in Central Amazonia at the
   Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragment Project (BDFFP) study sites. The
   results showed that edge effects changed the growth dynamics of the
   trees for at least 10 years after the disturbance, inducing an 18%
   reduction in tree growth during this period, and records of increased
   release events. We concluded that growth rings of edge trees are a
   valuable bioindicators for evaluating the temporal extent of edge
   effects, and therefore, they must be considered as relevant ecological
   indicators of historical environmental changes and forest fragmentation,
   promoting new insights into the resilience ability of trees when exposed
   to forest fragmentation processes.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Artworks are delicate objects representative of the most high values of
   human kind that require constant control over the situation they are in
   and effective actions to preserve them and deliver them safely to next
   generations. As such, the non-destructive or minimally destructive
   nature of operator-artwork interactions has been considered as essential
   in this field. The complete diagnosis of the status of the art object
   signifying a full knowledge of invisible defects and their morphology
   allows its timely and correct maintenance and ensures its durability. It
   is herein presented the basic technical information on the development
   of a portable system termed Digital Holographic Speckle Pattern
   Interferometry (DHSPI) for the structural diagnosis of works of art.
   DHSPI has been tested on a variety of conservation problems over the
   years. It is a completely portable and fully PC driven automated system
   for the detection and non-destructive diagnosis of the structural
   alterations of an artwork, whether they are defects lying on the
   subsurface or between the layers below it, the fringe number information
   allows the depth estimation and the complete documentation. The system
   exploits the benefits of a highly coherent laser beam as essential
   presupposition for remote on-field access-that is the main emphasis
   given here-to immovable/movable art objects. It takes advantage of a CCD
   camera as photosensitive medium to record the interference of the retro
   reflected object laser beam from the object under consideration with a
   twin reference laser beam. The device allows micro projections of the
   defects on the surface of the object to be detected with a resolution
   that corresponds to half the wavelength of the laser beam. Local
   disparities, in relation to the total response of the object, are
   directly correlated to the detected microdisplacement of object surface
   as structural defects. Special tailor-made software allows full control
   of the system, processing of the data, and extraction of anomalies.
   Direct visual qualitative observation of the displacement processes is
   followed as captured in the monitor. A second custom-made software-not
   presented in detail here-enables further processing of the results to
   improve their imaging, quantification, and dimensioning. The final
   result is a quantitative map of alterations, the coordinates, and the
   classification of their risks which can be also extracted if further
   information is necessary. The qualitative or quantitative documentation
   map can be used as a guide to the conservator for maintenance and
   restoration work. Further on, the system also allows observation of the
   object's response to climate changes in order to predict the formation
   of alterations or the evolution of existing ones providing the only
   known direct tool for scheduling preservation strategies.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Over the last two decades, scholars have developed an increasingly
   sophisticated range of approaches to studying the complex relationship
   between popular culture and politics. This article addresses three major
   weakness in this expanding body of research: (1) the analytic focus on
   the pop-cultural artifact itself rather than political actors and
   scholars doing the causal-political or pedagogical work, (2) a lack of
   attention to the question whether different culture consumers'
   interpretations and experiences of a pop-cultural artifact match those
   of scholars, and (3) the dearth of empirical studies verifying
   theoretical claims. I address these weaknesses by introducing the
   concept of pop-cultural mobilization to capture the active and
   deliberate appropriation of pop-cultural resources for a specific
   political purpose by political actors. I support my conceptual argument
   with empirical data for a case study on the TV show Game of Thrones
   (GOT): a qualitative content analysis of 55 political commentaries
   published between 2013 and 2016. The authors of these political
   commentaries purposefully contributed to a process of meaning-making
   among the American public by publishing their own interpretations of the
   TV show, especially what they perceived as strong parallels between the
   GOT narratives and climate change politics in the real world. The
   analysis demonstrates the interpretive openness of the pop-cultural
   artifact GOT, challenging the often-assumed interpretive authority of
   scholars' readings of a cultural narrative. There is even the potential
   for political opponents to make use of the same pop-cultural material to
   advance different policy agendas.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Haasgat fossil-bearing karstic system is situated within the
   Skurweberg Mountain range in the northeastern portion of the Fossil
   Hominids of South Africa UNESCO World Heritage Site in South Africa. As
   is the case for the nearby Gondolin hominin locality, Haasgat occurs in
   an area of substantial modern topographic relief that contrasts with the
   low-relief landscape of the southwestern extent of the World Heritage
   Site surrounding the Blauubank Stream Valley sites (e.g., Sterkfontein,
   Swartkrans, Kromdraai, Bolt's Farm). This suggests differential
   landscape formation processes during the Neogene and potentially novel
   palaeoecosystems and taphonomic processes governing karstic fossil
   assemblage composition across even a small geographic region. This is
   particularly critical given the overall paucity of taphonomic data from
   the region, the substantial cercopithecoid primate assemblage that is
   uniquely dominated by the basal baboon species Papio angusticeps, and
   the recent announcement of the first hominin specimen from Haasgat.Here
   we provide the first comprehensive taphonomic analysis of the Haasgat
   HGD faunal assemblage that was developed from ex situ calcified sediment
   blocks in the 1990s. There is direct evidence for biotic activity (e.g.,
   large-bodied carnivores and porcupines) mediating the formation of parts
   of the HGD faunal assemblage, including at least part of the primate
   craniodental and postcranial sample. There is minimal evidence for
   pre-depositional element UV exposure and weathering or winnowing of the
   assemblage, but there is abiotic distortion and crushing of elements.
   Our analysis has equally found that taphonomic data from the HGD
   assemblage is compromised by a modern 'overprint' of damage through
   mechanical preparation and a lack of documentation generated during
   sampling, processing, and initial curation. Nearly half the cortical
   surfaces and many dental specimens in the assemblage exhibit evidence of
   substantial preparation damage rendering many purported biotic
   modifications ambiguous or suspect. Element proportions may be
   artificially skewed towards craniodental specimens and more reflective
   of block selection and/or selective processing rather than original
   deposition composition. As a result, the Haasgat HGD sample provides
   only limited data on the depositional processes mediating karstic
   assemblage formation in the region, and ultimately serves as a
   cautionary tale of the impacts of palaeontological sampling strategies
   on subsequent analysis and research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

   timberline forests of Sikkim, Eastern Himalaya, we investigated, (i)
   forest structure and composition, (ii) regeneration status of dominant
   timberline tree species between timberline and treeline, (iii) influence
   of environmental variables in species composition, and (iv) relationship
   between environmental variables and ecological attributes. The study was
   conducted along the timberline stretch of Dzongri landscape nested
   within the Khangchendzonga National Park (UNESCO's World Heritage Site,
   2016), a core zone of Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve (in UNESCO
   WNBRs, 2018), Sikkim, India. We employed quadrat method to sample 9
   contiguous sites to capture all possible variations in timberline
   composition. Transect method was used to study the regeneration of woody
   taxa between timberline to treeline. In total, 20 woody species
   belonging to 10 genera and 6 families were recorded. Among these, Abies
   densa, Rhododendron lanatum and Sorbus microphylla exhibited higher
   dominance, comprising of 50% of the total importance value index (IVI)
   weightage. Betula utilis the common treeline species in much of the
   western and central parts of Himalaya was absent here. Tree density in
   studied timberline was significantly higher than its western Himalayan
   counterparts of Indian Himalayan region. Environmental variables viz.,
   elevation, slope, and humus were observed determinants of species
   composition across the study area. The species dominance correlated
   negatively (p&lt;0.01; n = 9) with species diversity and richness. We
   observed an irregular spatial pattern of timberline across the 9 study
   sites, and the extent of timberline elements (seedling; sapling; live
   tree or dead tree) ranged between 5.3m to 187.7m higher than the current
   timberline at different sites. The present trends suggest that upslope
   advancement is unlikely to occur in near future, while treeline
   densification is anticipated. Further investigations are suggested to
   develop a holistic understating of these timberline patterns across the
   Indian Himalayan region.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Understanding how ocean conditions influence fish distributions is
   critical for elucidating the role of climate in ecosystem change and
   forecasting how fish may be distributed in the future. Traditional
   species distribution models are often applied to scientific-survey data,
   which include species presence-absence information, to predict
   distributions. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models are promising tools as
   they can be applied to presence-only data (e.g., data collected from
   fishermen targeting a specific species or from observers in
   citizen-science programs). We used MaxEnt models to relate occurrence
   records of three marine pelagic fish (Atlantic herring, Atlantic
   mackerel, and butterfish) in fishery-dependent data to environmental
   conditions (sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a
   concentration from satellite remote sensing, bathymetry, and climate
   indices), and evaluated model performance by both cross-validation and
   validation using fishery-independent data. We developed monthly habitat
   suitability maps for these fish in the Northwest Atlantic Shelf area,
   and assessed the relative influence of environmental factors on their
   distributions. Across months, their suitable habitat areas varied with
   each species exhibiting inshore-offshore and north-south movements in
   response to changing environmental conditions. Overall, SST and
   chlorophyll-a concentration had the greatest influence on the
   distributions of these fish, with bathymetry having moderate influence
   and climate indices having little influence. Our application of MaxEnt
   models enabled us to integrate presence-only data and high resolution
   environmental data from satellite remote sensing to describe
   spatiotemporal distributions of marine pelagic fish. These models were
   used to hindcast species occurrence in relation to historical
   environmental conditions to evaluate their predictive performance, and
   have the potential to provide nowcasts in relation to current conditions
   or forecasts of species future distributions.</td>

   are considered as heritage sites with outstanding values to ecological
   communities by adding a further layer and support to the existing
   protection measures. However, mountain grasslands are increasingly under
   threat from human activities and impacts of climate change.MethodsUsing
   satellite imagery, we studied land use/land cover (LULC) patterns
   between 1973 and 2015. Individual interviews consisting of 240
   households for comparison and field data collection were conducted for
   accuracy assessment.ResultsFive categories of LULC types were identified
   from the image classification that included forestland, grassland,
   shrubland, bushland, and agricultural land. Between 1973 and 2015, the
   forestland, grassland, and shrubland covers were declined by 15.9%,
   53.6%, and 41.0%, respectively. In contrast, bushland and agricultural
   land were increased by 169% and 647%, respectively. The overall LULC
   classification accuracies for the four reference years ranged from 77.6
   to 86.5% with Kappa statistic of 0.69 to 0.80. The majority of
   respondents (92.5%) mentioned that the cover of forestland outsized the
   other land use land cover types followed by grassland in the
   past.ConclusionsThe stated indicators of land use/land cover changes
   linked to the impact of climate change were decline in milk yield and
   crop production, spread of livestock diseases, degradation of grazing
   lands, and change in the timing of rain. The results of the study
   suggest that human-climate related components were major drivers of land
   use/land cover dynamics that demand for proper management and
   conservation of mountain grassland ecosystem in Sidama South Ethiopia.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>In light of global trends in human population growth and urbanization,
   burgeoning cultural heritage tourism industries, and climate change,
   cultural heritage places in nearly every corner of the world are
   significantly threatened, and will remain so into the foreseeable
   future. Rock art sites are some of the most imperiled, with their
   exposed contexts posing unique challenges to conservation. Consequently,
   effective management of publically accessible rock art sites
   necessitates a sustainable approach that weighs visitation in regard to
   cultural significance and site stability. This essay integrates rock art
   stability and sustainability assessment methodologies at the Painted
   Rock Petroglyph Site in southwestern Arizona. The study specifically
   applies the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI) to evaluate the natural and
   anthropogenic weathering forces impacting the site, and the Heritage
   Asset Sensitivity Gauge (HASG) to assess site sustainability under
   existing management practices in relation to current and forecasted
   rates of visitation. A spatial analysis of aggregated RASI data shows
   that visitor foot traffic has had some of the most profound impacts to
   the petroglyphs. Unrestricted access to the site area is also highly
   correlated with the presence and location of vandalism and graffiti, and
   visitor-related trampling has adversely affected the site's surface
   artifact assemblage. Application of the HASG projects that, while
   existing management practices are fairly sustainable, they become less
   so under forecasted increases in visitation. Further, the HASG appraises
   the site's cultural significance as outweighing its market appeal,
   indicating management efforts should prioritize conservation over
   tourism-related development.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Increasing energy efficiency of the housing stock is one of the largest
   challenges in the built environment today. In line with the
   international Paris-Climate-Change-Conference 2015, Dutch municipalities
   and housing associations have embraced the ambition to achieve carbon
   neutrality for their social housing stock by 2050. However, most deep
   renovation designs for increasing the energy efficiency of dwellings
   focus on the relatively easy portion of the housing stock: postwar row
   housing. Furthermore, such design solutions are mostly produced without
   much care for architectural quality and cultural heritage, nor for
   testing for consumer preferences. Yet, such aspects are of major
   importance in tenement housing, particularly regarding the architectural
   quality of the huge numbers of walk-up apartment buildings from the
   inter-and postwar periods owned by housing associations in the larger
   cities. Renovation of buildings of this typology is more complex because
   of, among others, technical, social, and heritage factors. To support
   decisions in this complex context, a General Transformation Framework
   and a Roadmap has been developed for generating design solutions for
   deep renovation of representative parts of postwar walk-up apartment
   buildings with the aim to increase energy efficiency; retain its
   architectural legibility and cultural heritage value; and allow for the
   presentation of (end) users, with various options for adaptation to
   assess their preferences.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Risingdamp is a recurrent hazard to ancient buildings in Europe and its
   relevance is expected to increase in the future, due to climate changes.
   The presence of rising damp in walls does not only create an unpleasant
   climate in buildings, but it also enhances damage processes such as
   frost action, salt crystallization and biological growth, with possible
   consequences on the health of the inhabitants.The relevance of this
   problem is reflected by the large variety of products on the market. The
   wide and differentiated offer and the scarce scientific information on
   the effectiveness of the methods make it difficult, ( even) for
   professionals working in the field, to choose a suitable intervention on
   a sound basis.The JPICH-financed project EMERISDA (2014-2017) [1] aimed
   at evaluating the effectiveness of different intervention methods
   against rising damp. The project involved universities, research
   institutes, heritage agencies and companies (producers and contractors)
   in Belgium (BBRI, co-ordinator), Italy (CNR-ISAC, Universita' Ca'
   Foscari Venezia, Restauri Speciali s.r.l., Diasen s.r.l.) and The
   Netherlands (Delft University of Technology and the Cultural Heritage
   Agency of the Netherlands).The research methodology included the use of
   an on-line questionnaire and experimental research in laboratory, on
   scale models and on-site. Both traditional methods, such as chemical
   injection, and more recent techniques, such as the so-called
   "electro-physical" methods have been investigated. [2] The following
   results of the EMERISDA project are presented in this paper:- Results
   from on- line questionnaire.- Definition of an experimental procedure
   for the assessment of the presence of rising damp and of the
   effectiveness of the intervention.- Prototype of decision support tool,
   which provides insight into the feasibility and risks of existing
   methods against rising damp and supports actors involved in conservation
   in the choice and application of the methods against rising damp. (C)

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The BA litx area is located on the steep coastal side of the Tramuntana
   Range (Majorca), a mountainous region which was declared a World
   Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2011 in the cultural landscape category. The
   BA litx site was occupied by farming areas with dry stone constructions
   and water storing systems of both Roman and Islamic origin. The coastal
   landscape is characterised by a large fault escarpment of up to 260 m in
   height. Lateral spreading processes are favoured by local stratigraphy
   and tectonics in an energetic coastal dynamics scenario. Block spreading
   morphologies are identified along the escarpment, with large, rocky
   blocks of volumes up to 60 x 10(3) m(3) moving very slowly until their
   collapse. Consequently, a thick and highly karstified breccia deposit is
   accumulated at the base of the scarp. The lowest, oldest breccia outcrop
   has been dated (Th/U), and an age of 82.5 +/- 5.6 kyr was obtained,
   reflecting the time span this process has been active. Additionally,
   numerous geomorphological slope features are identified in the area:
   landslides, rockfalls, and, more specifically, long and deep cracks in
   the hanging wall block of the fault, which also reveal active lateral
   spreading processes. Coastal dynamics have been investigated by
   interpreting offshore geophysical studies, bathymetry data and borehole
   information to determine the role of wave energy in the stability of the
   slope. Additionally, 14 SAR images from the ALOS PALSAR satellite have
   been exploited for the present work, covering a period spanning from
   2007 to 2010, an anomalous rainy period in the region. Images were
   processed using the Persistent Scattered Interferometry (PSI) technique.
   PSInSAR results reveal that the rate of movement for the BA litx lateral
   spreading is extremely low (- 5.2 mm/year on average), but major
   activity has been detected in the NE sector, where velocity rates can
   reach values of up to - 16 mm/year Coastal dynamics in the area can
   explain this, as a small island generates wave refraction and reflection
   determining more intense erosive processes in the NE part, which lead to
   a greater destabilising effect on the slopes. A simple vulnerability
   approach has been developed to take the elements of cultural heritage
   into account. Vulnerability increases from SW to NE, in accordance with
   landslide activity. The BA litx case study could provide a testimony to
   the effects of mass movements and coastal dynamics in an exceptional
   example of Mediterranean agricultural landscape.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The accelerating impact of climate change on giant panda (Ailuropoda
   melanoleuca) habitats have become an international research topic.
   Recently, many studies have also focused on medium-sized mountain ranges
   or entire giant panda habitats to predict how habitats will change as
   the climate warms, but few say in detail what to do or where to focus
   efforts. To fill this gap, this paper presents a new method to take
   comprehensive, fine-scale evaluations incorporating climate change,
   human disturbance, and current conservation networks and translate them
   into practical countermeasures in order to help decision-makers set
   priority regions for conservation. This study looked at the core area of
   the Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries United Nations Educational,
   Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) World Natural Heritage
   site, namely Ya'an Prefecture, as a case study. The research employs the
   Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modeling algorithm to analyze how climate
   change will affect the habitats by 2050 under two scenarios: only
   considering the influence of climate change, and thinking about the
   coupled influence of climate change and human disturbance together. The
   results showed the following: (1) only considering climate change, the
   overall habitat that can be used by giant pandas in this region will
   increase, which differs from most of the previous results showing a
   decrease; (2) the new suitable habitat will shift westward, northward
   and eastward in this region; (3) conversely, the suitable habitat will
   be significantly reduced (about 58.56%) and fragmentized when taking
   into account human disturbance factors; (4) at present, the three small
   nature reserves are far from each other and cannot cover the present
   habitat well nor protect the potentially suitable habitats. Based on the
   comprehensive analysis of habitat shifts and our two field
   investigations, we suggest two regions that can be expanded into the
   conservation network to contain more potentially suitable habitats in
   the future. Furthermore, we used a geographical information system to
   incorporate high-resolution remote-sensing images from the GF-1
   satellite, land-cover maps, and a digital elevation model (DEM) to
   verify the possibility of our two suggested regions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Wilderness areas are ecologically intact landscapes predominantly free
   of human uses, especially industrial-scale activities that result in
   substantial biophysical disturbance. This definition does not exclude
   land and resource use by local communities who depend on such areas for
   subsistence and bio-cultural connections. Wilderness areas are important
   for biodiversity conservation and sustain key ecological processes and
   ecosystem services that underpin planetary life-support systems. Despite
   these widely recognized benefits and values of wilderness, they are
   insufficiently protected and are consequently being rapidly eroded.
   There are increasing calls for multilateral environmental agreements to
   make a greater and more systematic contribution to wilderness
   conservation before it is too late. We created a global map of remaining
   terrestrial wilderness following the established last-of-the-wild
   method, which identifies the 10% of areas with the lowest human pressure
   within each of Earth's 62 biogeographic realms and identifies the 10
   largest contiguous areas and all contiguous areas &gt; 10,000 km(2). We
   used our map to assess wilderness coverage by the World Heritage
   Convention and to identify gaps in coverage. We then identified large
   nationally designated protected areas with good wilderness coverage
   within these gaps. One-quarter of natural and mixed (i.e., sites of both
   natural and cultural value) World Heritage Sites (WHS) contained
   wilderness (total of 545,307 km2), which is approximately 1.8% of the
   world's wilderness extent. Many WHS had excellent wilderness coverage,
   for example, the Okavango Delta in Botswana (11,914 km(2)) and the
   Central Suriname Nature Reserve (16,029 km(2)). However, 22 (35%) of the
   world's terrestrial biorealms had no wilderness representation within
   WHS. We identified 840 protected areas of &gt; 500 km(2) that were
   predominantly wilderness (&gt; 50% of their area) and represented 18 of the
   22 missing biorealms. These areas offer a starting point for assessing
   the potential for the designation of new WHSs that could help increase
   wilderness representation on the World Heritage list. We urge the World
   Heritage Convention to ensure that the ecological integrity and
   outstanding universal value of existing WHS with wilderness values are
   preserved.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Selenga River delta (Russia) is a large (&gt;600km(2)) fluvially
   dominated fresh water system that transfers water and sediment from an
   undammed drainage basin into Lake Baikal, a United Nations Educational,
   Scientific, and Cultural Organization World Heritage Site. Through
   sedimentation processes, the delta and its wetlands provide important
   environmental services, such as storage of sediment-bound pollutants
   (e.g., metals), thereby reducing their input to Lake Baikal. However, in
   the Selenga River delta and many other deltas of the world, there is a
   lack of knowledge regarding impacts of potential shifts in the flow
   regime (e.g., due to climate change and other anthropogenic impacts) on
   sedimentation processes, including sediment exchanges between deltaic
   channels and adjacent wetlands. This study uses field measurements of
   water velocities and sediment characteristics in the Selenga River
   delta, investigating conditions of moderate discharge, which have become
   more frequent over the past decades (at the expense of peak flows,
   Q&gt;1,350m(3)s(-1)). The aims are to determine if the river system under
   moderate flow conditions is capable of supporting sediment export from
   the main distributary channels of the delta to the adjacent wetlands.
   The results show that most of the deposited sediment outside of the
   deltaic channels is characterized by a large proportion of silt and clay
   material (i.e., &lt;63m). For example, floodplain lakes function as sinks
   of very fine sediment (e.g., 97% of sediment by weight&lt;63m).
   Additionally, bed material sediment is found to be transported outside
   of the channel margins during conditions of moderate and high water
   discharge conditions (Q1,000m(3)s(-1)). Submerged banks and marshlands
   located in the backwater zone of the delta accumulate sediment during
   such discharges, supporting wetland development. Thus, these regions
   likely sequester various metals bound to Selenga River sediment.</td>

   through their business practices and by engaging guests with
   interpretation and targeted messages. Yet little is known about how
   tourism operators along the GBR perceive climate change, or what actions
   they believe are most effective to address climate change impacts on the
   GBR. We describe a set of semi-structured interviews with 19 tourism
   operators in the Whitsundays and Cairns, the most popular tourism
   destinations along the GBR. Using a thematic analysis to code and report
   patterns within the data, we show tourism operators recognise the threat
   of climate change and strongly support increased action to address it.
   Most respondents are hesitant to engage their guests about climate
   change despite acknowledging an interest, expertise, and responsibility
   to do so. Understanding the barriers preventing tourism operators from
   addressing climate change is an important step towards helping them, and
   the tourists visiting the region, take action to protect the GBR.</td>

   earth. It is evidence of millennia of adaptation of humans to the
   environment. Cultural heritage can be intangible (e.g., traditional
   knowledge, customs, ritual practises or beliefs) and tangible, the
   latter including various categories of places, from cultural landscapes
   and sacred sites to archaeological complexes, individual architectural
   or artistic monuments and historic urban centres. The most world wide
   representative Cultural and Natural Heritages are included within
   "UNESCO Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and
   Natural Heritage''. They are the flagship of a large number of monuments
   and sites diffused at both national and local level. The sites and
   remains are not always in equilibrium with the environment. They are
   continuously impacted and weathered by several internal and external
   factors, both natural and human-induced, with rapid and/or slow onset.
   These include major sudden natural hazards, such as earthquakes or
   extreme meteorological events, but also slow, cumulative processes such
   as the erosion of rocks, compounded by the effect of climate change,
   without disregarding the role of humans, especially in conflict
   situations. Cultural Heritages required proper infrastructures to be
   used by local populations. Such infrastructures are part of the heritage
   itself and nowadays need adequate attention for a sustainable
   conservation and maintenance. Typical example is the Siq of Petra
   (Jordan). In the present paper the role of engineering geology and earth
   science in general is described for the conservation and management of a
   masterpiece of cultural properties such as the Siq of Petra. The
   relevance and potential of these areas of study was not fully
   appreciated in the past. At present, however, their contribution is
   increasingly acknowledged as the need for an inter-disciplinary
   approach, which would bring together art history, science, management
   and socio-economic concerns, has become more and more apparent. This
   paper will focus on the relevance of modern technologies for
   investigation and monitoring, as a fundamental step for a safeguarding
   project that have to enhance, as much as possible, traditional knowledge
   and local sustainable practises, in conservation techniques.</td>

   following two sections: (1) review of backscattered amplitude analysis
   and observations, and (2) review of interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis
   and applications. This study also provides an overview of a wetland

   long in the eastern-central part of the Algerian coast. The coastline
   characterized by sandy beaches, hotels and tourist facilities, airport,
   port, villages and towns has known during these last decades several
   threats like storms, floods and erosion. The present work concerns the
   mapping of the physical and socioeconomic vulnerability of the Gulf
   Coast of Bejaia to sea level rise, using Coastal Vulnerability Index
   (CVI) and geospatial tools. The Physical CVI (CVIPhys) is calculated
   from seven physical variables: geomorphology, coastal slope, coastal
   regional elevation, sea level rise rate, shoreline erosion/accretion
   rates, tidal range and significant wave height. On the other hand, the
   parameters population, cultural heritage, roads, railways, land use and
   conservation designation constitute, for their part, the socioeconomic
   CVI (CVIeco). The values obtained from the calculation of CVIPhys vary
   between 3.53 and 81.83. These results revealed that 22.42 km of the
   studied coastline has a low physical vulnerability, 21.68 km a high
   vulnerability and 15.83 km a very high vulnerability, indicating that
   the most part of the coastline (53.59%) is vulnerable to sea level rise.
   According to the obtained values of CVIeco, the most vulnerable areas of
   high and very high risk represent 31.81 km of the total coastline. They
   were found along the western (Bejaia and Tichy) and eastern (Aokas, Souk
   El Tenine and Melbou) coast, while the least vulnerable stretches,
   covering 38.19 km of the total length of the coast, occupy the rest of
   the area. This study highlighted areas that will be most affected by
   future sea level rise (SLR) and storm events. It revealed that several
   development projects of Bejaia Gulf Coast, including tourist expansion
   areas, are planned in sites identified as very vulnerable. The results
   obtained from this assessment could guide local planners and
   decision-makers in developing coastal management plans in the most
   vulnerable areas.</td>

   and strains of domestic animals, and their variations. Although a recent
   census indicated that there were 40 species and over 8000 breeds of
   domestic animals; for the purpose of conservation biology the diversity
   between and within breeds rather than species is regarded to be of
   crucial importance. This domestic animal genetic diversity has developed
   through three main evolutionary events, from speciation (about 3 million
   years ago) through domestication (about 12000 years ago) to specialised
   breeding (starting about 200 years ago). These events and their impacts
   on global animal genetic resources have been well documented in the
   literature. The key importance of global domestic animal resources in
   terms of economic, scientific and cultural heritage has also been
   addressed. In spite of their importance, there is a growing number of
   reports on the alarming erosion of domestic animal genetic resources.
   This erosion of is happening in spite of several global conservation
   initiatives designed to mitigate it. Herein we discuss these
   conservation interventions and highlight their strengths and weaknesses.
   However, pivotal to the success of these conservation initiatives is the
   reliability of the genetic assignment of individual members to a target
   breed. Finally, we discuss the prospect of using improved breed
   identification methodologies to develop a reliable breed-specific
   molecular identification tool that is easily applicable to populations
   of livestock breeds in various ecosystems. These identification tools,
   when developed, will not only facilitate the regular monitoring of
   threatened or endangered breed populations, but also enhance the
   development of more efficient and sustainable livestock production
   systems.</td>

   are emerging, no planning tools exist for bottom-up, community-based
   management of the issue. This paper forms part of an overarching
   research project that aims to fill this gap by developing a bottom-up
   planning guide (the Guide). The paper tests the first of the proposed
   Guide's five phases: the scoping phase. It presents the results of
   workshops conducted with two Australian Indigenous rangers groups. While
   existing studies document Indigenous peoples' perceptions of climate
   change in general, none have focussed on their perceptions of impacts on
   cultural heritage sites. Here, Indigenous rangers related strong
   perceptions of particular climate change impacts on specific cultural
   sites in particular bio-regions. While the rangers were actively engaged
   with sites, they felt site management should be extended in the face of
   additional threats from climate change. Rangers were able to nominate a
   preferred methodological approach, based on a risk analysis of
   biophysical hazards, as well as local adaptive capacity building in the
   face of governance challenges. Various barriers to adaptation planning
   and resource limitations were identified but these were not regarded as
   insurmountable in terms of the current project. Testing of the scoping
   phase of the Guide suggested rangers had a strong organisational
   capacity to achieve practical adaptation results.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Seasonal cattle movements have been an important part of the living
   cultural heritage in Bhutan for centuries. Herders migrate south every
   winter to graze their cattle on subtropical pastures and to work in
   orange orchards. They return north to their villages in spring to grow
   summer crops. However, the practice of transhumant agropastoralism is
   under increasing pressure on account of changes in land-use policies,
   climate change and a declining labour force as youth seek alternative
   livelihoods. This research investigated the impact of changes in
   land-use policy, with emphasis on the Land Act 2007, on current and
   future livelihoods of transhumant herders in Bhutan. During in-depth
   interviews with 24 transhumant herders and nine livestock advisors, and
   seven focus-group discussions with 64 participants including herders,
   downstream residents and development agency personnel, perspectives on
   this issue were gathered. Findings revealed a lack of herder awareness
   of changes in land-use policies and minimal consultation of herders
   during policy development. Confusion and uncertainty about the proposed
   redistribution of grazing rights and restrictions on herd movements have
   resulted in confusion and resentment and have created conflicts between
   upstream and downstream communities. Herders with no current
   alternatives are concerned about their future livelihoods, whereas
   others are leaving it to their children to decide their future. It is
   concluded that the motive behind nationalisation of rangeland is noble
   and timely, but there are flaws in the redistribution plan. Transhumant
   agropastoralism is already in decline and there is no need to push
   towards its end through legislation. Transhumant practices could be left
   to evolve towards what may be their natural end. Sudden stoppage of
   inter-district transhumance without offering meaningful alternatives to
   herders could result in negative environmental and socioeconomic
   impacts. In future, policy development needs to increasingly embrace
   science and be based on evidence. A genuine participatory process with
   citizen engagement could avoid the unintended negative impacts likely to
   be faced by transhumant herders with marginal land holdings, who depend
   on this production system for their livelihoods.</td>

   interest to management agencies. However, these isolated species,
   especially those with sensitive life history traits, are at high risk
   for the adverse effects of genetic drift and habitat degradation by
   non-native wildlife. Here, we study the population genetic diversity,
   structure, and stability of a classic "island giant" (Xantusia
   riversiana, the Island Night Lizard) on San Clemente Island, California
   following the removal of feral goats. Using DNA microsatellites, we
   found that this population is reasonably genetically robust despite
   historical grazing, with similar effective population sizes and genetic
   diversity metrics across all sampling locations irrespective of habitat
   type and degree of degradation. However, we also found strong
   site-specific patterns of genetic variation and low genetic diversity
   compared to mainland congeners, warranting continued special management
   as an island endemic. We identify both high and low elevation areas that
   remain valuable repositories of genetic diversity and provide a case
   study for other low-dispersal coastal organisms in the face of future
   climate change.</td>

   often vulnerable to climate change and other pressures. Therefore,
   enhancing resilience to climate change is important for their long term
   viability. This paper explores how management options can be evaluated
   on their resilience implications. The approach included five steps: (1)
   characterizing the system, (2) characterizing the impacts of climate
   change and other disturbances, (3) inventorying management options, (4)
   assessing the impacts of these on climate resilience, and (5) follow-up
   analysis. For the resilience assessment, we used a set of 'resilience
   principles': homeostasis, omnivory, high flux, flatness, buffering, and
   redundancy. We applied the approach in a case study in a Dutch wetlands
   region. Many options in the region's management plan contribute to
   resilience, however, the plan underutilised several principles,
   particularly flatness, but also redundancy and omnivory for agriculture,
   and high flux for nature. Co-benefits was identified as an important
   additional criterion to obtain support for adaptation from local
   stakeholders, such as farmers. The approach provided a relatively quick
   and participatory way to screen options. It allowed us to consider
   multiple impacts and sectors, multiple dimensions of resilience, and
   stakeholder perspectives. The results can be used to identify gaps or
   pitfalls, and set priorities for follow-up analyses.</td>

   to establish structural and compositional attributes. Stratified random
   sampling based on major soil types was used and nine plant variables

   species and family names; basal circumference; plant height; depth and
   diameter of tree canopy; number of stems per plant; plant life status;
   number of trees and shrubs; and number of saplings. A total of 3114
   woody plants were sampled, comprising an assemblage of 28 families, 63
   genera and 106 species. The results suggest alluvial floodplain flanking
   the Limpopo River is a biodiversity hotspot with high plant species
   diversity (H'= 1.8-2.2) 1/ha, taller trees (P&lt; 0.05) with median height
   per plot ranging between 6.1-10 m, high canopy volume at 105783
   (443155m(3)/ha) and basal area (16.9-111m(2)/ha). The Arenosols-Regosol
   stratum had significantly shorter trees (P&lt; 0.05) with median height per
   plot between 3-4 m, low species diversity (H'= 0.8-2.3) 1/ha, low basal
   area (3.23-48.2m(2)/ha) and low canopy volume (6687.08(155965.00)
   m(3)/ha. The Cambisol-Luvisol stratum in the western section of MCL had
   high number of stems/plant at 1.65 (1.40), high woody plant density
   483.33 (900.00) 1/ha, F-3,F-137 = 19.07, P&lt; 0.05), high density of dead
   plants 16.67 (133.30) 1/ha and high sapling density 208.33 (850.00)
   1/ha. The present study suggests soil type is a key determinant of woody
   vegetation structure and composition. The study recommends regular
   vegetation monitoring, periodic update of plant species inventories in
   protected areas, control of exotic invasive woody plant species found
   along the Limpopo river floodplain within the biodiversity management

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Background: Traditional Environmental Knowledge (TEK) related to
   truffles represents an under-investigated area of research in
   ethnobiology. Nevertheless, truffles, in a few southern European areas,
   and notably in South Piedmont, represent a crucial component of the
   local economy and cultural heritage.Methods: Thirty-four white truffle
   (Tuber magnatum Pico) gatherers, locally known as trifulau, aged between
   35 and 75 years and living in a few villages and small towns of the
   Langhe and Roero areas (South Piedmont, NW Italy), were interviewed
   in-depth during the years 2010-2014 regarding their ecological
   perceptions, truffle gathering techniques, and the socio-ecological
   changes that have occurred during the past several decades.Results: A
   very sophisticated ethnoecological knowledge of the trees, soils, and
   climatic conditions considered ideal for searching for and finding white
   truffles was recorded. Moreover, a very intimate connection between
   gatherers and their dogs plays a fundamental role in the success of the
   truffle search. However, according to the informants, this complex
   ethnoecological cobweb among men, truffles, dogs, and the environment
   has been heavily threatened in the past few decades by major changes:
   climate change, in which the summer has become a very hot and dry
   season; social changes, due to a more market-oriented attitude of
   younger gatherers; and especially environmental and macro-economic
   dynamics, which followed the remarkable expansion of viticulture in the
   study area.Conclusion: The TEK of white truffle gatherers indicates the
   urgent need for fostering sustainable gastronomy-centred initiatives,
   aimed at increasing the awareness of consumers and food entrepreneurs
   regarding the co-evolution that has inextricably linked locals,
   truffles, and their natural environment during the past three centuries.</td>

   (GeoSure, DiGMapGB, National Landslide Database, Geological Indicators
   of Flooding and Susceptibility to Groundwater Flooding) has provided an
   enhanced understanding of geohazards within the Core Area and Buffer
   Zone of the UNESCO Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage List (WHL) site,
   UK. This knowledge contributes to the preservation of this industrial
   heritage site that is included as the UK demonstration site of the Joint
   Programming Initiative on Cultural Heritage and Global Change (JPI-CH)
   Heritage Plus project PROTHEGO: 'PROTection of European cultural
   HEritage from GeO-hazards' which is mapping geohazards in the 400+ WHL
   sites of Europe using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) combined
   with geological information. Acting as baseline geohazard
   characterisation to feed into PROTHEGO's WP5-WP6, our analysis reveals
   that flooding from fluvial water flow and emergence of groundwater at
   the ground surface (across over 50% and 40% of the Core Area,
   respectively) are the main geohazards that require careful
   consideration, together with slope instability along the steep sides of
   the Derwent river valley (e.g. 1.4 km(2) landslide deposits found at
   Cromford within the Buffer Zone). The UK Climate Projections 2009
   (UKCP09) for the Derwent river catchment suggest drier summers (e.g.
   -15.1 to -19.4% change in summer precipitation in 2050; -18.5 to -23.1%
   in 2080), wetter winters and increased annual temperatures (e.g. +2.4 to
   +2.5 degrees C in 2050; +3.4 to +3.5 degrees C in 2080) under a medium
   greenhouse gas emission scenario. These could exacerbate flooding and
   slope instability and extend the areas susceptible to geohazards, posing
   further challenges for heritage management.</td>

   hazards and to extreme climatic events. At the same time, cultural
   heritage is a significant driving force in the European economy, society
   and culture. This paper suggests that a novel paradigm, capable to
   tackle the issue of protecting Historical Centres with Cultural Heritage
   Value with a holistic approach, would allow a sustainable management of
   their values. Historical Centres with Cultural Heritage Value
   conservation needs to be integrated into wider urban -and metropolitan-
   strategies. Setting up a novel methodology for the analysis and
   management of risk of Heritage City Centres would promote a wider
   understanding of the social and ecological costs associated with the
   loss of cultural assets. This can lead to better informed clear and
   measurable targets and evidence-based decision making. The resulting
   strategies should help costly damage to valuable Historical Centres with
   Cultural Heritage Value assets, but will also lead to the enhancement of
   Heritage City Centres to ensure progressive resilience measures are
   implemented in the future in metropolitan areas. (C) 2016 The Authors.

   to the Heroic Age of arctic and Antarctic Exploration which is
   associated with such events as the First International Polar Year, the
   search for the Northwest Passage, and the race to the Poles. However,
   these and other key messages of significance are often challenging to
   communicate because the remote locations of such sites severely limit
   opportunities for visitor experience. This lack of awareness can make it
   difficult to rally support for costly heritage preservation projects in
   arctic and Antarctic regions. Given that many polar heritage sites are
   being severely impacted by human activity and a variety of climate
   change processes, this raises concerns. In this paper, we discuss how
   virtual heritage exhibits can provide a solution to this problem.
   Specifically, we discuss a recent project completed for the Virtual
   Museum of Canada at Fort Conger, a polar heritage site located in
   Quttinirpaaq National Park on northeastern Ellesmere Island
   (http://fortconger. org).</td>

   the Naracoorte Caves (South Australia), ancient DNA (aDNA) has not been
   integrated into any palaeontological study from this World Heritage
   site. Here, we provide the first evidence of aDNA preservation in
   Holocene- and Pleistocene-aged fossil bone from a deposit inside
   Robertson Cave. Using a combination of metabarcoding and shotgun
   next-generation sequencing approaches, we demonstrate that aDNA from
   diverse taxa can be retrieved from bulk bone as old as 18 600 cal a BP.
   However, the DNA is highly degraded and contains a lower relative
   proportion of endogenous sequences in bone older than 8400 cal a BP.
   Furthermore, modelling of DNA degradation suggests that the decay rate
   is rapid, and predicts a very low probability of obtaining informative
   aDNA sequences from extinct megafaunal bones from Naracoorte (ca. 50 000
   cal a BP). We also provide new information regarding the past faunal
   biodiversity of Robertson Cave, including families that have not been
   formerly described in the fossil record from here before. Collectively,
   these data demonstrate the potential for future aDNA studies to be
   conducted on material from Naracoorte, which will aid in the
   understanding of faunal turnover in southern Australia. Copyright (C)

   (Vanellus resplendens) exemplifies the need to integrate traditional
   ecological knowledge for a better comprehension of mountain ecosystems
   and for their effective management towards sustainability of highland
   communities. The mythology associated with the Andean lapwing prompts
   inclusion of ethnoecological insights of Neotropical forests and
   highland grasslands of the Andes and its societal appropriation in the
   imaginary of Andean cultural landscapes. This appropriation would
   determine the paradigm shift from biodiversity preservation in natural
   areas to new biocultural heritage conservation throughout the Andean
   cordillera. I present a gamut of nine categories to aid in understanding
   of how biocultural relations with this bird pose questions about
   identity, landscape stewardship and environmental services. Even more,
   the Andean lapwing might be a potential indicator for climate change, as
   it is observed with examples of its defensive behavior, habitat
   selection and extensive husbandry in mountain protected areas.
   Therefore, Andean cultural heritage benefits not only from intangible
   and monumental material productions, but also from the idealized
   mountain lifescape and the engineering made indirectly by ancestral uses
   kept through generations (or man-agement) of highland cultures, making
   the symbiotic Andean biocultural landscape possible.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Increased ice melting revealed in 2006-2007 many reminiscences of
   ancient human activity around ice patches near Mt Galdhopiggen, Norway's
   highest mountain peak. The public limited company "Klimapark 2469 AS"
   was established to develop a heritage interpretation product and to
   study climate change. A 60-metre long ice tunnel is excavated in the ice
   patch Juvfonna, where guided walks and a display presenting climate
   change, archeology, Norse mythology, and glaciology are offered. The
   heritage product, "Mimisbrunnr Climate Park 2469" (MK2469), is based on
   collaboration between scientific institutions, public authorities, the
   National Mountain Museum, and private tourist companies. The ambition is
   to combine science, environmental learning, interpretation, heritage
   tourism, and local development. Based on interviews and relevant
   documents, we have studied the network - the actors, their ambitions,
   and networking processes: What are the perceived opportunities,
   challenges, outcomes, and success factors? Good strategic work has
   resulted in extensive public funding and sponsorship, and MK2469 has
   become a diverse, quality heritage product, but so far with little
   commercial success. An important outcome is the fruitful exchange of
   experiences, between public and private partners, tourism and science
   interests, amateurs and professionals, and between local, regional and
   national actors. The network has shown to be quite dynamic.</td>

   elico Chilo ( PECh) project, which is to be installed in the Mar Brava
   area of Ancud, Chile. Like many other social conflicts involving wind
   energy developments that have arisen around the world, we find
   significant public support for wind energy but resistance by the local
   population to a particular wind farm development. This paper presents
   the results of an exploratory research study whose aim was to understand
   the local community's responses to the PECh project sent to the
   Environmental Impact Assessment System in Chile. A qualitative design
   primarily with dialogic inquiry techniques has been used. The sample was
   intentional, identifying the main actors involved in the conflict. The
   results show that the social conflict is related to multiple factors: a)
   the perception of damages to natural and cultural heritage; b) the
   perception of negative strong effects that the wind farm development
   would have on local productive activities; c) local community distrust
   towards the company, local authorities and environmental regulators, and
   d) the threat to life projects of the local people. In order to drive
   the sustainable development of renewable energy to mitigate the effects
   of climate change, more attention should be paid to these aspects.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Recent research on climate change mitigation has emphasized
   decision-making within tourism businesses is vital for sustainable
   futures. However, there has been little consideration of how the age of
   buildings and (historic) property frames, modifies or constrains the
   sector's response to climate change. Through surveys of accommodation
   providers in South-West England, this paper explores relationships
   between property age, energy performance and pro-environmental
   innovations requiring adjustment to the fabric of buildings. Findings
   are presented from empirical research with small- and medium-sized
   tourism enterprises occupying properties often well over a century old.
   This paper's large-scale data-set and series of intensive case histories
   demonstrate that property age does not play a straightforward role in
   encouraging or hindering efforts among accommodation providers to tackle
   climate change. Some (but not all) businesses with the oldest buildings
   performed and responded strongest, successfully introducing the latest
   renewable energy technologies, although adapting older buildings was not
   without complications and cost implications. Conceptually, this research
   points to the limits of calls for greater pro-environmental behaviour
   change without clearer understanding of the contexts and settings in
   which such behaviour takes place. Its findings are important to
   heritage-based destinations worldwide: accommodation in heritage
   buildings can be a unique selling point.</td>

   two ancient churches located on Torcello Island (Venetian Lagoon) and
   subsequently analyzed. The site had been selected presenting patinas of
   exceptional amount and thickness, elsewhere generally found as thin
   alteration layers covering stone surfaces or within black crusts on
   monuments in urban environments. Optical and mineralogical analyses
   suggest that these patinas are not the result of a simple deposition
   process, but originate as surface "transformations" of the substrate,
   and are mainly composed of dihydrate calcium oxalate (weddellite) and
   gypsum. Among the experimental techniques, isotope analyses (C and S)
   have been specifically carried out aiming at achieving a better
   understanding of their origin and possible causes of formation. The
   observed carbon isotopic fingerprint reveals in fact a strong biological
   fractionation recorded in the oxalate patina (delta C-13 ranging from
   -22.3% to -28.0%), almost exclusively attributable to C3 pathway
   photosynthesis processes. Slightly negative sulfur isotope ratio values
   seem to be inversely correlated with patina exposure to atmospheric
   agents and pollutants. The results obtained prove that calcium oxalate
   originates from a biomineralization process induced by lichen
   colonization in specific environmental conditions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Freshwater is a scarce and precious resource in California; its overall
   value is being made clear by the current severe drought. The
   Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is a critical node in a complex water
   supply system that extends throughout much of the western U.S. wherein
   demand is exceeding supply. The Delta also underpins a major component
   of the U.S. economy, helps feed a substantial part of the country, is a
   unique and valuable ecological resource, and is a place with a rich
   cultural heritage. Sustaining the Delta is a problem that manifests
   itself in many dimensions including the physical structure of the Delta,
   the conflicting demands for water, changing water quality, rapidly
   evolving ecological character, and high institutional complexity. The
   problems of the California Delta are increasingly complex, sometimes
   chaotic, and always contentious. There is general agreement that current
   management will sustain neither the Delta ecosystem nor high-quality
   water exports, as required under the Delta Reform Act, so there is a
   renewed urgency to address all dimensions of the problem aggressively.
   Sustainable management of the Delta ecosystem and California's highly
   variable water supply, in the face of global climate change, will
   require bold political decisions that include adjustments to the
   infrastructure but give equal emphasis to chronic overuse and misuse of
   water, promote enhanced efficiency of water use, and facilitate new
   initiatives for ecosystem recovery. This new approach will need to be
   underpinned by collaborative science that supports ongoing evaluation
   and re-adjustment of actions. Problems like the Delta are formally
   "wicked" problems that cannot be "solved" in the traditional sense, but
   they can be managed with appropriate knowledge and flexible
   institutions. Where possible, it is advisable to approach major actions
   incrementally, with an eye toward avoiding catastrophic unexpected
   outcomes. Collaborative analyses of risks and benefits that consider all
   dimensions of the problem are essential. Difficult as the problems are,
   California has the tools and the intellectual resources to manage the
   Delta problem and achieve the twin goals of a reliable water supply and
   an ecologically diverse Delta ecosystem.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Competing interests in land-use change trigger conflicts between
   institutional bodies, local residents, land developers and environmental
   NGOs. This is even more dramatic in fragile areas such as coastal
   regions, which are characterized by intense human and environmental
   activity. Moreover, increasing urban expansion around metropolitan areas
   often disregards environmentally sensitive areas and is countered by
   both institutional response and regulation. This results in a
   conflicting coastal environment characterized by minimal urban planning,
   sprawl, pollution due to industrial expansion, climate change and land
   use competition between residential and recreational development and
   cultural heritage conservation interests.We present an econometric
   analysis of environmental resource management in coastal metropolitan
   areas. Surprisingly, there is only a small amount of literature on a
   quantitative approach to environmental conflicts and land-use in coastal
   areas. This paper contributes to the current state of knowledge by
   suggesting an econometric model which encompasses the main relationships
   between land-use, population dynamics and economic development.Not only
   are environmental risks and sustainability taken into account in the
   model equations, but variables related to human mobility, employment,
   land for housing, agriculture and land in pristine state are also
   considered. These key indicators are thought to be endogenous to the
   system and to predict the probability of conflict occurrence.
   Furthermore, likely conflict-types are estimated under various simulated
   scenarios. Uniquely, we utilize simultaneous equation modeling where
   both human and environmental pressures combine in driving conflicts. The
   empirical results show that environmental sustainability and housing
   land use are key determinants in mitigating conflicts in areas
   experiencing demographic, economic and climatic pressures. (C) 2014

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Coastal archaeological sites in Newfoundland and Labrador are currently
   under considerable threat, with important knowledge of the province's
   history and prehistory potentially lost to erosion. Climate change will
   exacerbate existing coastal hazards, thus causing even greater loss of
   archaeological resources in the future. Action is needed now to protect
   or retrieve the information from significant sites under threat in
   coastal areas before they are completely eroded. In responding, cultural
   resource managers face potentially tough questions about which sites are
   at risk, how to prioritize at-risk sites for action, and what management
   option is most appropriate. A 2011 study by Westley et al. estimated
   that one-fifth of the coastal archaeological sites in three study
   regions of Newfoundland were highly vulnerable to the impacts of
   relative sea-level rise (SLR), storm surges or coastal erosion over the
   next 15-50 years. The Coastal Archaeological Resources Risk Assessment
   (CARRA) project aims refine the site vulnerability assessment approach
   and inform management decisions about at-risk sites. This includes
   employing high resolution coastal topography (e.g. LiDAR), revised SLR
   projections, updated coastal erosion estimates and resurveyed site
   positions in our improved vulnerability classification. Once at-risk
   sites have been identified, prioritizing action at these sites is
   especially difficult. A review of the published literature revealed few
   examples of applied processes and those identified rely heavily on the
   quantification and ranking of risk factors with less emphasis on the
   nature and rarity of the archaeological resource. The CARRA project is
   reviewing current practices in at-risk site prioritization with the goal
   to create best practice scenarios for one of our Newfoundland study
   areas. This process will involve detailed hazard assessment of two
   at-risk sites, including coastal erosion and shoreline retreat studies,
   as well as an impact assessment of known archaeology resources at each
   site under future hazard scenarios. The final step in the management of
   at-risk archaeological sites is the design and implementation of an
   action plan. The CARRA project aims to inform this step through a review
   of current case studies and management actions at threatened sites
   across Canada. Two case studies from Newfoundland are briefly introduced
   to illustrate the types of local actions taken to mitigate erosion at
   archaeological sites. These case studies will be reviewed in detail with
   the intention to share adaptation strategies as part of a new community
   of practice for heritage managers responsible for coastal archaeology
   resources in Canada.</td>

   way they live today. Thus, current cities need to be redeveloped towards
   less use of carbon in their day to day operations. Pedestrianized
   environment is one of the approaches used in reducing carbon foot print
   in cities. Heritage cities are the first to be looked into since they
   were built in the era in which motorized vehicles were minimal.
   Therefore, the research explores users' satisfaction on assessment of
   physical attributes of pedestrianization in Melaka Historical City, a
   UNESCO World Heritage Site. It aims to examine users' satisfaction on
   pedestrian facilities provided within the study area using pair wise
   questionnaire comparison approach. A survey of 200 respondents using
   random sampling was conducted in six different sites namely Jonker
   Street, Church Street, Kota Street, Goldsmith Street, Merdeka Street to
   Taming Sari Tower and Merdeka Street to River Cruise terminal. The
   survey consists of an assessment tool based on a nine-point scale of
   users' satisfaction level of pathway properties, zebra pedestrian
   crossing, street furniture, personal safety, adjacent to traffic flow,
   aesthetic and amenities. Analytical hierarchical process (AHP) was used
   to avoid any biasness in analyzing the data collected. Findings show
   that Merdeka Street to Taming Sari Tower as the street that scores the
   highest satisfaction level that fulfils all the required needs of a
   pedestrianized environment. Similar assessment elements can be used to
   evaluate existing streets in other cities and these criteria should also
   be used in planning for future cities.</td>

   quintessential aspect of intangible heritage: a symbol of Barbadian
   pride and industry - the country's motto. It adorns the silver dollar
   coin and is on the logo of the Barbados Tourism Authority. Barbados has
   its own unique ways of preparing and cooking the flying fish, and it is
   part of the national cuisine. But the availability of the species is at
   risk, as are its associated traditions, and there is no regulatory
   framework to protect this icon of national heritage. It is threatened by
   a maritime boundary and fisheries dispute, it struggles under the legacy
   of price controls that hamper the profitability of the fishing industry,
   it is uncertain whether there will still be people to harvest the
   species in the next fifty years, there is a significant variability in
   abundance which could affect the accessibility of flying fish to
   Barbadians, and climate change could lead to the local extinction of
   flying fish. So should the flying fish continue to be the leading icon
   of Barbados? Although not a unanimous decision, the majority of
   Barbadians surveyed felt that the flying fish should be preserved as
   part of the island's heritage. Therefore, recommendations are made here
   for the preservation of this representative of local intangible heritage
   traditions.</td>

   accessible to the general public. The subsequent increase of museum loan
   services increases the risk of accelerated degeneration. Hence, in
   addition to the age related deterioration, transportation can be another
   source of damage. Despite modern packaging technologies, vibrations and
   environmental climate change can add up and damage the transported
   object. Besides obvious mechanical influencing quantities, a main
   concern is the detection of climate induced damages. Changes in the
   relative humidity cause inner strain, which may lead to defect
   formations and damages. White light fringe projection was applied to
   detect object changes due to variations of the relative humidity. First
   measurements indicated a sensitivity down to a relative humidity change
   of 6 %. Recently, the Stuppach Madonna, a painting by Matthias Grunewald
   (painted 1514 - 1516), was investigated with shearography after the
   return from an exhibition. The obtained shearograms revealed a variety
   of defects like bubbles, delaminations and tunnels caused by wood worms.
   Even the planking of the wooden panel and existing putty could be
   detected.This paper describes the first steps of a project with the aim
   of investigating and implementing a method to detect and classify
   transport related damages on works of art.</td>

   arguments are made: first, that it merits recognition as part of the
   country's (and region's) natural heritage, and second, that its unusual
   form of composition challenges the tangible/intangible divide. The haar
   is not a site that one can visit, but rather an atmospheric process that
   comes and goes when conditions permit, embodying transience and
   ephemerality - characteristics of intangible heritage. Considering the
   nature of this phenomenon in full for the first time in scholarly
   studies, as well as the importance of microclimates in heritage
   landscape theory, this research adds to the growing body of literature
   calling for a re-examination of the tangible/intangible dichotomy in

   on environments and societal structures, the central notion of human
   capacity to effectively respond to altered human conditions has received
   little attention. Yet climate change has the potential to bring about
   undesirable shifts in the human experience on the social, economic,

   impacting the human social order on a substantial scale. Understanding
   past responses to shifts in the human living condition can help mitigate
   social upheaval in the wake of climate change disruption.First Nations
   Peoples in Canada have valuable cultural resources and experiences that
   may be informative in confronting the social challenges presented by
   climate change. A research project was undertaken to document exposure
   sensitivities, adaptive strategies and adaptive capacities in two First
   Nation communities in Saskatchewan. The research was informed by past
   experiences the communities had with turbulent changes in their
   sociocultural environments and the nature of responses that cushioned
   them amidst the changes. The community people identified strengths, such
   as philosophy, indigenous knowledge, and practical approaches to
   visioning the future for the benefit of their youth, as important
   elements of survival and overcoming negative effects of change.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Remote sensing technologies such as terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and
   light detection and ranging (LIDAR) can now provide accurate spatial
   data for describing topographic patterns in landscapes and mapping the
   fine geometric detail of complex structures. Interdisciplinary studies
   using such data for characterising heritage sites are now widespread,
   but it is less common for data derived from these technologies to be
   used in an operational setting to 'engage' local people with the idea of
   future change. Three-dimensional landscape models using TLS and LIDAR
   are a powerful way of communicating climate change to lay audiences on a
   local level and the use of multi-scale spatial data can help to show the
   anticipated impacts of climate change at heritage sites. The aim of this
   paper is to present the results of a project designed to produce a
   photorealistic geospatial model of the historic quayside at Cotehele
   Quay, Cornwall, UK. Our central aim was to generate a spatially accurate
   and visually realistic three-dimensional model of the site for use in
   local engagement strategies. TLS and LIDAR data were collected and
   processed to produce a three-dimensional model. The key image processing
   stages included: registration to a national co-ordinate system, meshing
   using 3D reshaper and visualisation creation in 3DS Max. The resulting
   model will permit spatial consideration of the impact of management
   strategies at the site. The over-arching application of this method
   beyond the study site will provide a platform for discussion that
   addresses the needs of site managers and the expectations of local
   communities.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Upper Middle Rhine Valley, granted the status of a World Heritage
   site, is well known for its unique inner narrow valley of Quaternary age
   with its historical legacy of numerous medieval castles and old towns.
   Less known is that this has always been a risk area of floods and
   gravitative mass movements. Up to the recent past, mainly ice floods
   caused enormous damage. The inhabitants of the valley were well aware
   that they lived in a risk area, but they had learned to handle the flood
   hazard. With the demise of ice floods over the last 40 years, due to
   climate change and because of the additional heating of the river water
   by power plants, the awareness of flood hazards has been much
   diminished, in contrast to that of potential damage by rockfalls and
   landslides which were also much feared in the past, though at the local
   level only. Still in the people's memory is the Kaub catastrophe of
   March 10, 1876, when 28 persons were killed by a landslide. Nowadays,
   even minor rockfalls are a major threat, as they will affect the
   much-used traffic lines on both banks of the river, in particular the
   railroads. Therefore, since 2002, on behalf of German Rail (Deutsche
   Bahn, DB), all problematic slopes have been protected by costly
   steel-ring nets, although they are an aesthetic problem by UNESCO
   standards. The feeling of absolute safety created among the public is
   only subjective, though, as planners are well aware of. Moreover, the
   impact of modern climate change on slope stability is nearly unknown.
   Therefore, it is still necessary to develop a risk map for the narrow
   valley, with emphasis on gravitational hazards.</td>

   preservation of remains in this region. Apart from utilising a
   Geographical Information System (GIS) to analyse archaeological data, it
   can also be utilised as an effective tool for managing the protection of
   archaeological, faunal and geological remains. This paper proposes that
   remains at Willandra Lakes be recorded and monitored with a GIS
   database. This process should combine the use of digital photography and
   Global Positioning Systems (GPS) at middens, hearths, quarries and
   burials to effectively record and monitor any changes at a site. A
   regularly updated GIS map of the area can be used to quickly identify
   any sites that may be threatened by extreme environmental factors or
   increased visitors in the area.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A commitment to conservation of a place is based on the sense of place
   expressed by its "conceptual community", including those who are not its
   residents in the geographical sense, but who nonetheless identify with
   it for various reasons. With the global nature of environmental issues
   being clearly recognized, such communities form a "terrain of
   consciousness" (Berg and Dasmann 1978), extending responsibility for
   conservation across cultures, time and space. Although the social
   mobility and diversity brought about by today's technology often work
   against the development of a sense of place, they also allow the
   formation of such conceptual communities, who can highlight local
   distinctiveness while at the same time positioning local issues in a
   global context, so generating a sense of global responsibility. In the
   case of Tasmania, Australia, recent international interest in its
   ecologically and culturally significant places, such as Recherche Bay
   and the Styx Valley, has intensified the focus on forest issues,
   building on Tasmania's already well-recognized history of
   environmentalism. It is important that these issues be recognized in
   Japan in particular, where a rising awareness about climate change and
   mass consumerism has alerted the public to the problem of deforestation;
   however the fact that Tasmania is one of the major sources of woodchips
   for paper production is not widely known. Awareness by the consumer, it
   is argued, is a foundation for forming a sense of global responsibility
   and it is necessary to form a conceptual community of those committed to
   the same issue. Cross-cultural collaboration is therefore necessary, and
   creativity can be an effective facilitating agent for this. This paper
   illustrates this point, through the example of the Kodama Forest, a
   forest of tree spirits, in North East Tasmania, that arose from such a
   collaboration between a group of Japanese students and a local community
   group. The collaboration also facilitated meaningful learning
   opportunities for the students, who chose to study in Tasmania because
   of its natural environment. The forest now provides a cultural heritage
   that also defines the evolution of this conceptual community through
   on-going collaboration. The importance of human connection at all
   levels, local, regional and global, in promoting environmental
   sustainability is addressed through the example of this forest.</td>

   mega-river basins, groundwater stress is increasing due to changing
   ocean-land disposition, hydroclimatic extremes, over-exploitation and
   natural/anthropogenic contamination. Such change in coastal hydrodynamic
   process makes an impact in to the resilience of groundwater-sourced
   drinking water vulnerability. The groundwater responses studied in this
   work in the ecologically-vulnerable, UNESCO World Heritage site of the
   Sundarbans delta-front aquifers at the river Ganges-Brahmaputra mega
   delta, demonstrate a unique example of such intricacies and
   complexities. High-resolution, temporal, depth-dependent hydraulic
   connectivity and hydrochemistry was studied for this complex, climate
   driven, tidal-induced hydrological interactions between surface water
   (seawater of Bay of Bengal [BoB] and Ganges river water) with shallow
   and deep groundwater by stable isotopic (delta O-18 and delta D)
   signatures and piezometry. A wide range of salinity content and delta
   O-18 composition of groundwater samples for 14-25 (salinity: 3-45 ppT,
   delta O-18: -3.63 to -1.15 parts per thousand) and 30-50 meter below
   ground level (mbgl) (salinity: 5-25 ppT, delta O-18: -3.41 to -1.34
   parts per thousand) was recorded, while, comparatively, a narrow range
   of temporal variability was observed for the depths of 115 (salinity:
   1-4 ppT, delta O-18: -5.04 to -2.15 parts per thousand) and 333mbgl
   (salinity: 1 to 3 ppT, delta O-18: -4.43 to -2.81 parts per thousand).
   Study results revealed that vertical transport of solute has been
   induced by coastal hydrodynamics. However, human interferences, in terms
   of groundwater abstraction and land use-land cover change (e.g. brackish
   aquaculture) do have substantial impact on evolving groundwater
   response, thereby impacting resilience to drinking water option in this
   densely populated area. Fluctuations of groundwater level in relation
   with delta O-18(gw), composition showed shallow depths (14-50 mbgl) are
   hydraulically connected by local flow and conducive of chemical
   exchanges. The deeper groundwater (115-330 mbgl depths) flow suggests
   regional-scale hydraulic connections along flow paths. In-spite of
   sub-meter scale seasonal groundwater level changes, salinity variability
   is observed between 1 and 4 ppT at &gt; 100 mbgl depths, suggest mixing
   between chemically-distinct water reservoirs, conserving hydraulic
   mass-balance. However, such observation suggests severe implications for
   groundwater vulnerability, which might aggravate with future
   intensification of irrigational abstraction, as well as with changing
   hydroclimatological regime and extreme events. Thus, future planning and
   management strategies of sustainable supply of safe water in such
   ecologically-sensitive groundwater systems need to incorporate such
   dynamic chemical evolution.</td>

   footprint of cultural heritage buildings. Commonly adopted measures to
   decrease the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of historical buildings are
   targeted at improving their energy efficiency through insulating the
   building envelope, and upgrading their heating, cooling and lighting
   systems. However, there are complex issues that arise when mitigating
   climate change in the cultural built heritage sector. For instance,
   preserving the authenticity of heritage buildings, maintaining their
   traditional passive behaviours, and choosing adaptive solutions
   compatible with the characteristics of heritage materials to avoid an
   acceleration of decay processes. It is thus important to understand what
   the enablers, or the barriers, are to reduce the carbon footprint of
   cultural heritage buildings to meet climate change mitigation targets.
   This paper investigates how climate change mitigation is considered in
   the management and preservation of the built heritage through
   semi-structured interviews with cultural heritage experts from the UK,
   Italy and Norway. Best-practice approaches for the refurbishment of
   historical buildings with the aim of decreasing their energy consumption
   are presented, as perceived by the interviewees, as well as the
   identification of the enablers and barriers in mitigating climate change
   in the cultural built heritage sector. The findings emphasise that
   adapting the cultural built heritage to reduce GHG emissions is
   challenging, but possible if strong and concerted action involving
   research and government can be undertaken to overcome the barriers
   identified in this paper.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Understanding biogeographic patterns and the mechanisms underlying them
   has been a main issue in macroecology and biogeography, and has
   implications for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem sustainability.
   Evergreen broad-leaved woody plants (EBWPs) are important components of
   numerous biomes and are the main contributors to the flora south of 35
   degrees N in China. We calculated the grid cell values of species
   richness (SR) for a total of 6265 EBWP species in China, including its
   four growth-forms (i.e., tree, shrub, vine, and bamboo), and estimated
   their phylogenetic structure using the standardized phylogenetic
   diversity (SPD) and net relatedness index (NRI). Then we linked the
   three biogeographical patterns that were observed with each single
   environmental variable representing the current climate, the last
   glacial maximum (LGM)present climate variability, and habitat
   heterogeneity, using ordinary least squares regression with a modified
   t-test to account for spatial autocorrelation. The partial regression
   method based on a general linear model was used to decompose the
   contributions of current and historical environmental factors to the
   bio-geographical patterns observed. The results showed that most regions
   with high numbers of EBWP species and phylogenetic diversity were
   distributed in tropical and subtropical mountains with evergreen shrubs
   extending to Northeast China. Current mean annual precipitation was the
   best single predictor. Topographic variation and its effect on
   temperature variation was the best single predictor for SPD and NRI.
   Partial regression indicated that the current climate dominated the SR
   patterns of Chinese EBWPs. The effect of paleo-climate variation on SR
   patterns mostly overlapped with that of the current climate. In
   contrast, the phylogenetic structure represented by SPD and NRI was
   constrained by paleo-climate to much larger extents than diversity,
   which was reflected by the LGMpresent climate variation and
   topography-derived habitat heterogeneity in China. Our study highlights
   the importance of embedding multiple dimensions of biodiversity into a
   temporally hierarchical framework for understanding the biogeographical
   patterns, and provides important baseline information for predicting
   shifts in plant diversity under climate change.</td>

   proposed by experts as a solution to climate change vulnerability. But
   this prescription tends to focus on adaptation to future external
   threats, subtly validating embedded processes of racial capitalism that
   have historically dehumanised and endangered residents and their
   environments in the first place. This article focuses on majority Black
   areas said to be vulnerable to extreme weather events and targeted for
   expert-driven resilience enhancements in America's capital city,
   Washington, DC. Drawing on key insights from Black radical, feminist,
   and antiracist humanist thought, we reimagine resilience through an
   abolitionist framework. Using archival analysis, oral histories, a
   neighbourhood-level survey, and interviews conducted between 2015 and
   2018, we argue that abolitionist climate justice entails a centring of
   DC's historical environmental and housing-related racisms, the
   intersectional drivers of precarity and trauma experienced by residents
   beyond those narrowly associated with "climate"; and an ethics of care
   and healing practiced by those deemed most at risk to climate change.</td>

   heritage science and conservation community to map and monitor the state
   of the art of the knowledge referring to natural and human-induced

   Preservation of Cultural Heritage and Resources Threatened by Climate
   Change of Geosciences-launched to take stock of the existing but still
   fragmentary knowledge on this challenge, and to enable the community to
   respond to the implementation of the Paris agreement-includes 10
   research articles. These papers exploit a broad range of data derived
   from preventive conservation monitoring conducted indoors in museums,
   churches, historical buildings, or outdoors in archeological sites and
   city centers. Case studies presented in the papers focus on a
   well-assorted sample of decay phenomena occurring on heritage
   materials-e.g., surface recession and biomass accumulation on limestone,
   depositions of pollutant on marble, salt weathering on inorganic
   building materials, and weathering processes on mortars in many local-
   to regional-scale study areas in the Scandinavian Peninsula, the United
   Kingdom, Belgium, France, Italy, Greece, and Panama. Besides monitoring,
   the methodological approaches that are showcased include, but are not
   limited to, original material characterization, decay product
   characterization, and climate and numerical modelling on material
   components for assessing environmental impact and climate change

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Influenced by global concerns around climate change mitigation,
   reduction in carbon emissions and energy security, countries are
   increasingly focussing on increasing the share of renewable energy.
   Various national and provincial level authorities are aggressively
   promoting renewable energy expansion, resulting in new geographies of
   renewable energy. The expansion of renewable energy, particularly
   large-scale projects, is contingent upon access to natural resources.
   However, areas that have high natural resource endowment for renewable
   energy, often have other overlapping uses of natural resources,
   including livelihoods and biodiversity. And renewable energy projects
   located in these areas compete with these other multiple uses of natural
   resources, often leading to unintended consequences. This study employs
   ethnographic methods to analyse the case of local opposition to a 113 MW
   wind power project, located in the Western Ghats of India. India, an
   emerging economy, is the fourth largest producer of wind energy
   worldwide and is expanding the share of renewable energy through
   national as well as provincial level policies. The Western Ghats are a
   designated UNESCO world heritage site for their exceptional biodiversity
   and the wind power project conflicted with natural resource-based
   livelihoods of indigenous populations and threatened their subsistence
   agricultural practices along with posing a threat to the ecology of the
   landscape. As a result, local activists protested against the wind power
   project and this contestation was animated and influenced by a variety
   of public, civic and private actors and institutions across scale. This
   paper uses insights from political ecology and energy geography to shed
   light on the interaction between these multiple actors and how this
   interaction mediated the contestations around renewable energy. It
   focuses on the micropolitics of this contestation to highlight the
   social and political processes that underpin the transition to
   sustainable energy. It sheds light on local struggles and contestations
   around renewable energy projects in conjunction with national and global
   commitments and shows how contestations around renewable energy in the
   Global South are distinct from the largely prevalent NIMBY approaches in
   the developed countries. This study contributes to global debates around
   governing renewable energy, particularly in developing countries.</td>

   management agencies address community needs such as adaptation,
   livelihoods, involvement and empowerment to build resilience by
   minimising community-induced forest depletion. The management regimes of
   the Sunderbans in Bangladesh and India have relative advantages in
   biodiversity conservation in response to climate change. This research
   also finds that biodiversity conservation actions are challenged by poor

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Altai Mountains are well-known for their unique archaeological
   records, with rich, chronologically sequenced Palaeolithic, Neolithic
   and the Bronze Age (late fourth-early first millennium BC) sites and, in
   particular, the Iron Age Scytho-Siberian and early historical monuments
   represented by burial sites, ritual structures, and rock-art. The Altai
   prehistoric archaeological localities are distributed across a broad
   range of topographic and ecological settings, encompassing altitudinal
   zones from 800m asl in the lower reaches of glacial river valleys up to
   2500/3000m asl on the high mountain plateaus. The partial spatial
   overlap of these (often multi-component) geoarchaeological loci over
   time suggests that similar adaptive strategies were employed by
   countless generations of hunter and later nomadic communitiestheir
   actions constrained by the locally specific forms of (palaeo-)relief and
   the associated ecosystems. The dynamics of the initial occupation of the
   boreal and alpine Altai landscapes and subsequent processes of
   (re-)colonisation during the Final Pleistocene-Holocene transition are
   directly linked to transformations in the regional hydrological systems
   after the LGM. The principal settings for early pastoral settlements
   were the xerothermic grasslands that formed on the flat
   glacio-lacustrine terraces which rise above the modern fluvial
   floodplainsthe remains of ice-dammed wastage lake basins drained at the
   end of the Pleistocene (15,000-13,000year BP). Marked climatic changes,
   evidenced by regional variations in temperature and humidity across the
   territory, are well attested in the geological, biotic and
   archaeological records. The initial Sub-Boreal aridification correlated
   with the beginnings of the Altai Bronze Age traditions continued until
   the early Iron Agecausing an expansion of parkland-steppe in the main
   valleys and a forest retreat in the foothills. Mountain steppes
   constituted the most essential food-procurement habitat for the Holocene

   variables driving mangrove biodiversity and produce baseline
   biodiversity maps for the Sundarbans world heritage site-the Earth's
   largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem. Location The Bangladesh
   Sundarbans, South Asia. Methods We collected species abundance,
   environmental and disturbance data from 110 permanent sample plots
   (PSPs) covering the entire Bangladesh Sundarbans (6,017 km(2)). We
   applied generalized additive models to determine the key variables
   shaping the spatial distributions of mangrove diversity and community
   composition. Biodiversity maps were constructed using covariate-driven
   habitat models, and their predictive performances were compared with
   covariate-free (i.e., direct interpolation) approaches to see whether
   the inclusion of habitat variables bolster spatial predictions of
   biodiversity or whether we can rely on direct interpolation approaches
   when environmental data are not available. Results Historical forest
   exploitation, disease, siltation and soil alkalinity were the key
   stressors causing loss of alpha and gamma diversity in mangrove
   communities. Both alpha and gamma diversity increased along the
   downstream-to-upstream and riverbank-to-forest interior gradients.
   Mangrove communities subjected to intensive past tree harvesting,
   disease outbreaks and siltation were more homogeneous in species
   composition (beta diversity). In contrast, heterogeneity in species
   composition increased along decreasing salinity and
   downstream-to-upstream gradients. We find that the surviving
   biodiversity hotspots (comprising many globally endangered tree species)
   are located outside the established protected area network and hence
   open to human exploitation. We therefore suggest bringing them
   immediately under protected area management. Main conclusions We provide
   the first habitat-based modelling and mapping of alpha, beta and gamma
   diversity in threatened mangrove communities. In general, habitat-based
   models showed better predictive ability than the covariate-free
   approach. Nevertheless, the small margin of differences between the
   approaches demonstrates the utility of direct interpolation approaches
   when environmental data are unavailable.</td>

   tropics, threatening carbon sink potential of tropical dry forests.
   Hence, understanding their responses to the changing climate is of high
   priority to facilitate sustainable management of the remnant dry
   forests. In this study, we examined the long-term climate-growth
   relations of main tree species in the remnant dry Afromontane forests in
   northern Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess the
   dendrochronological potential of selected dry Afromontane tree species
   and to study the influence of climatic variables (temperature and
   rainfall) on radial growth. It was hypothesized that there are potential
   tree species with discernible annual growth rings owing to the
   uni-modality of rainfall in the region. Ring width measurements were
   based on increment core samples and stem discs collected from a total of
   106 trees belonging to three tree species (Juniperus procera, Olea
   europaea subsp. cuspidate and Podocarpus falcatus). The collected
   samples were prepared, crossdated, and analyzed using standard
   dendrochronological methods. The formation of annual growth rings of the
   study species was verified based on successful crossdatability and by
   correlating tree-ring widths with rainfall.ResultsThe results showed
   that all the sampled tree species form distinct growth boundaries though
   differences in the distinctiveness were observed among the species.
   Positive and significant correlations were found between the tree-ring
   widths and rainfall, implying that rainfall plays a vital role in
   determining tree growth in the region. The study confirmed the formation
   of annual growth rings through successful crossdating, thus highlighted
   the potential applicability of dendroclimatic studies in the
   region.ConclusionsOverall, the results proved the strong linkage between
   tree-ring chronologies and climate variability in the study region,
   which further strengthens the potential of dendrochronological studies
   developing in Ethiopia, and also has great implications for further
   paleo-climatic reconstructions and in the restoration of degraded lands.
   Further knowledge on the growth characteristics of tree species from the
   region is required to improve the network of tree-ring data and quality
   of the chronology so as to successfully reconstruct historic
   environmental changes.</td>

   impacts, such as enhanced coastal erosion driven by intensified storms
   and sea-level rise, will be destructive or problematic for coastal
   archaeological heritage. Approaches to this problem range from
   broad-scale GIS-based vulnerability assessments to site-scale monitoring
   and survey. In all cases, the approach chosen should be based on the
   best-available data on the local historic environment and pattern of
   coastal change. Therefore, this paper will demonstrate how such data can
   be successively acquired and enhanced using an integrated approach that
   builds on and refines a previously conducted broad-scale vulnerability
   assessment. This approach was adopted in the study region (Northern
   Ireland) owing to a lack of coherent and up-to-date information on
   shoreline change. This approach incorporated the GIS-based Digital
   Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) to quantify and analyze local shoreline
   change. DSAS is a software extension for ESRI ArcGIS which allows
   calculation of rate-of-change statistics using past shorelines
   identified from georeferenced historic maps and vertical aerial imagery.
   Additionally, a field survey was conducted to assess the condition of
   recorded sites, and identify unrecorded ones. Results revealed a more
   complex pattern of shoreline change in the study area (Magilligan
   Foreland, Lough Foyle) than previously anticipated, with zones of
   significant erosion interspersed with areas of stability or advance.
   Fifty-one new sites ranging from the prehistoric period to the Second
   World War were also identified. The new information was used to develop
   a priority classification based on site significance, condition and risk
   level which improved significantly on the uniform classification of the
   original broad-scale assessment.</td>

   buildings, in coastal areas are vulnerable to climate impacts including
   inundation, deterioration, and destruction from sea-level rise and
   storm-related flooding and erosion. However, research that assesses the
   trade-offs between actions for protecting vulnerable and valuable
   cultural resources under budgetary constraints is limited. This study
   focused on developing a decision support model for managing historic
   buildings at Cape Lookout National Seashore. We designed the Optimal
   Preservation Decision Support (OptiPres) model to: (a) identify optimal,
   annual adaptation actions for historic buildings across a 30-year
   planning horizon, (b) quantify trade-offs between different actions and
   the timing of adaptation actions under constrained budgets, and (c)
   estimate the effectiveness of budget allocations on the resource value
   of historic buildings. Our analysis of the model suggests that: (1)
   funding allocation thresholds may exist for national parks to maintain
   the historical significance and use potential of historic buildings
   under climate change, (2) the quantitative assessment of trade-offs
   among alternative adaptation actions provides generalizable guidance for
   decision makers about the dynamics of their managed system, and (3) the
   OptiPres model can identify cost-efficient approaches to allocate
   funding to maintain the historical value of buildings vulnerable to the
   effects of climate change. Therefore, the OptiPres model, while not
   designed as a prescriptive decision tool, allows managers to understand
   the consequences of proposed adaptation actions. The OptiPres model can
   guide park managers to make cost-effective climate adaptation decisions
   for historic buildings more transparently and robustly.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Terrace agriculture in Latin America has existed for millennia. It is
   the result of local, traditional knowledge on slope management, and has
   adapted to social and environmental change. Agriculture is being
   affected by climate variability, i.e. random changes of inter-annual
   variation of temperature and precipitation. This variability has
   increased with climate change, affecting food security and increasing
   poverty over peasant communities that rely on rainfed agriculture. For
   agriculture adaptation to climate change, most research attention has
   been paid to agroecology and agrobiodiversity management, while the role
   of agriculture terracing has been less studied as an adaptation
   strategy. The objective of this paper was to determine how terrace
   management contributes to the agriculture adaptation to climatic
   variability in peasant communities in the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca. Located
   in southeast Mexico, this is a very diverse region in terms of geology,
   landforms and biotic resources where terrace agriculture has been
   practiced for at least 3400-3500 BP. Mixteca Alta is higher than 2000
   m.a.s.l., and the climate is temperate with seasonal summer rainfall.
   The research method was qualitative, ethnographic and participative,
   using semi structured interviews as primary tool. The results of
   interviews were grouped in four categories: climate changes and their
   impact on the agriculture calendar; productive systems; characteristics
   of terraces for agriculture; and social and economic problems of peasant
   communities. Interviewees indicated that the main changes have been on
   quality and quantity of the precipitation, specifically a decrease in
   total rainfall but an increase in rainfall intensity, a delayed onset of
   the rainy season and an early start of the midsummer heat. These changes
   have resulted in a delay in maize sowing and in an increase in the
   potential exposure of crops to frost. Early cultivation of traditional
   cajete maize (using residual soil moisture) in terraces was acknowledged
   as an efficient practice facing these changes. Interviewees recognized
   that terrace flat terrains, with deeper soils and higher residual soil
   moisture than sloping soils, allowed for coping with climatic changes
   and water scarcity. Cajete maize is part of the cultural heritage of the
   indigenous communities in this region, but is being negatively affected
   by a double exposure: to climate change and to adverse agricultural
   policies that favor large scale market agriculture and neglect family
   farming. However, in a context of intense climate change processes, this
   traditional farming practice is an important staple source for the rural
   population in this region.</td>

   then has arisen, for example, from re-investigation of existing sites
   and discoveries of new sites, developments in geochronology and the
   formulation and application of new concepts and models. Both the GCR
   site lists and the supporting site documentation now require updating in
   the light of this progress. Today there is greater emphasis on the
   wider, non-scientific values of geoconservation including, for example,
   on ecosystem services, links with biodiversity and cultural heritage,
   geotourism and the benefits for human health and wellbeing through
   improved understanding of dynamic landscapes, climate change and natural

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Teotihuacan Valley has witnessed the rise and fall of various
   civilizations since it was first inhabited by sedentary societies 3,500
   years ago. Given its location in a semi-arid environment, Teotihuacan
   has featured prominently in debates about the role of water and water
   management in the development of sedentism, culture, primary states, and
   large, complex societies. While many previous discussions tended to echo
   Wittfogel's "hydraulic hypothesis," focusing on the ability of an elite
   few to monopolize water resources, we instead turn to a growing corpus
   of research showing varied water management strategies through time
   potentially resulting in distinct patterns of social organization. In
   this palimpsest landscape hydraulic and agricultural strategies were
   constrained not merely by present environmental conditions, but also by
   very real and material legacies of previous behavior. We discuss the
   state of research regarding these adaptations (and social responses) to
   water scarcity from the Early-to-Middle Formative Period (1250-650 B.C.)
   through the independence of Mexico (A.D. 1810), noting how previous
   fundamental assumptions about agriculture and hydraulic management in
   the Teotihuacan Valley have led to a significant number of neglected
   concepts and potential adaptations. If we are to address the current
   destruction of the Teotihuacan Valley's ecological and cultural
   resources in response to national development and climate change, a
   historical-ecological perspective is necessary to disentangle the
   relevant processes that have shaped the landscape-and the cultures
   residing within it-to this day. This article is categorized under:

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Oceanic islands can be relatively isolated from overfishing and
   pollution sources, but they are often extremely vulnerable to climate
   and anthropogenic stress due to their small size and unique assemblages
   that may rely on a limited larval supply for replenishment.
   Vulnerability may be especially high when these islands bear permanent
   human populations or are subjected to regular or intermittent fishing.
   Since the late 1970's, Brazil has been establishing marine protected
   areas (MPAs) around its four oceanic island groups, which concentrate
   high endemism levels and are considered peripheral outposts of the
   Brazilian Biogeographic Province. In 2018, the Brazilian legally marine
   protected area increased &gt; 10-fold, but most of the similar to 1,000,000
   km(2) of MPAs around Brazil's oceanic islands are still unknown and
   unprotected. Here, we provide the first detailed quantitative baseline
   of benthic reef assemblages, including shallow and mesophotic zones, of
   the Fernando de Noronha Archipelago (FNA). The archipelago is partially
   protected as a no-take MPA and recognized by the UNESCO as a World
   Heritage Site, but also represents the only Brazilian oceanic island
   with a large permanent human population (3,000 people), mass tourism (up
   to 90,000 people per year) and a permanent small-scale fishing
   community. The influence of depth, wave exposure, and distance from the
   island and shelf edge on the structure of benthic assemblages was
   assessed from benthic photoquadrats obtained in 12 sites distributed in
   the lee and windward shores of the archipelago. Unique assemblages and
   discriminating species were identified using Multivariate Regression
   Trees, and environmental drivers of dominant assemblages' components
   were evaluated using Boosted Regression Trees. A total of 128 benthic
   taxa were recorded and 5 distinct assemblages were identified. Distance
   to the insular slope, depth and exposure were the main drivers of
   assemblages' differentiation. Our results represent an important
   baseline for evaluating changes in benthic assemblages due to increased
   local and global stressors.</td>

   landscape-scale conservation design and planning is an important effort
   for solving complex socioecological problems. Despite recognition that
   culture and nature are not distinct categories, this division remains
   influential in North American conservation policies, practices, and
   management. The North American Landscape Conservation Cooperatives
   (LCCs) aimed to develop long-term landscape-scale conservation
   priorities integrating both natural and cultural resources through
   multi-stakeholder, regional partnerships. During 2017-2018, we conducted
   ethnographic fieldwork and key informant interviews with Appalachian LCC
   (AppLCC) partners. Here we examine the general strategies, goals, and
   values of the AppLCC to understand how cultural and natural resources
   were incorporated into partnership activities. We find that both
   conceptual and practical barriers exist for integrating cultural and
   natural resource information and values for landscape-scale conservation
   planning. Future large-landscape conservation partnerships looking to
   integrate conservation strategies would benefit from increasing the
   diversity of institutional representation and examining how cultural and
   natural resource projects are relatively prioritized. In addition,
   greater reflection on the ideology of conservation, theory of cultural
   resource management, and the value of cultural resources may improve
   conservation outcomes. By expanding the definition of cultural
   resources, greater connections with natural resource management
   priorities and strategies can be identified and leveraged to advance
   integrated conservation. These challenges and potential pathways to
   integrated conservation are examined through the lens of the AppLCC.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The North faces significant health disparities, especially among its
   many Indigenous peoples. In this article we discuss historical,
   environmental, and cultural variables that contribute to these
   disparities and propose a One Health approach to address them in a
   holistic and culturally appropriate manner. The One Health paradigm
   recognizes the interdependence among the health and well-being of
   people, animals and the environment. As such, the framework aligns well
   with many Indigenous world views. This proactive, interdisciplinary,
   constructivist, and collaborative approach promise earlier detection of
   risks and threats, as well as more effective responses, in part by
   engaging community level stakeholders in all stages of the process. In
   the far North, humans, especially Indigenous peoples, continue to live
   closely connected to their environment, in settings that exert
   significant impacts on health. In recent decades, rapid warming and
   elevated contaminant levels have heightened environmental risks and
   increased uncertainty, both of which threaten individual and community
   health and well-being. Under these circumstances especially, One
   Health's comprehensive approach may provide mitigating and adaptive
   strategies to enhance resilience. While many of the examples used in
   this manuscript focus on Alaska and Canada, the authors believe similar
   conditions exist among the indigenous and rural residents across the
   entire Circumpolar North.</td>

   natural assets on earth, yet few studies have assessed ecological risks
   from the perspective of world heritage conservation and management. A
   methodology for considering ecological threats and vulnerabilities and
   focusing on heritage value was introduced and discussed for the Bogda
   component of the Xinjiang Tianshan Natural World Heritage Site. Three
   important results are presented. (1) Criteria layers and ecological risk
   showed obvious spatial heterogeneity. Extremely high-risk and high-risk
   areas, accounting for 13.60% and 32.56%, respectively, were mainly
   gathered at Tianchi Lake and Bogda Glacier, whereas the extremely
   low-risk and low-risk areas, covering 1.33% and 17.51% of the site, were
   mainly distributed to the north and scattered around in the southwest
   montane region. (2) The level of risk was positively correlated with the
   type of risk, and as the level of risk increases, the types of risk
   increase. Only two risk types were observed in the extremely low-risk
   areas, whereas six risk types were observed in the high-risk areas and
   eight risk types were observed in the extremely high-risk areas. (3)
   From the perspective of risk probability and ecological damage, four
   risk management categories were proposed, and correlative strategies
   were proposed to reduce the possibility of ecological risk and to
   sustain or enhance heritage value.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>As the largest managed terrestrial ecosystem on the earth, grasslands
   play the irreplaceable important roles in the production of livestock
   husbandry, the protection of regional ecological environment, and the
   preservation of pastoral nationality and their cultural heritages.
   Grasslands are considered as natural resources supporting primarily for
   food production in the past but increasingly for human wellbeing now.
   The utilization efficiency and productivity of the grassland resources
   are strongly dependent upon grassland management practices such as
   grazing and cutting, forage production, vegetation stability, to name a
   few. The implication, scope, and significance of grassland resources
   continuously expand with increasing awareness and improved management of
   human on grassland values. Traditionally, grasslands are used as the
   important means of production and livelihood for human beings because
   they can provide sustainable livestock products (such as meat, milk, and
   wool) and ecological services (such as carbon storage and biodiversity
   conservation). At present, grasslands are often referred to as a living
   capital, and such capital benefit of grasslands is determined by
   grassland characteristics, management mode, and governance, and thereby
   grassland management is a central issue for grassland ecosystem
   sustainability. The traditional grassland management is mainly based on
   control of livestock carrying capacity or stocking rate, aiming at
   increasing animal and plant productivity. However, it is considerably
   difficult to determine a realistically achievable carrying capacity,
   given that natural grasslands are heterogeneous in vegetation and
   temporal primary production as a result of environmental fluctuations.
   As the impacts of environmental changes and human activities increase,
   it is necessary to carry out targeted grassland management (such as
   climate change adaptation, biodiversity loss, degradation). Adaptive
   grassland management emphasizes the maintenance of grassland
   systematical productivity and ecological sustainability by ensuring
   "livestock-vegetation balance". That is, the practice of grassland
   management should conform to the complexity of frequent climatic
   stresses and intensively human disturbance. When social demand for
   grassland products and ecological services continues to increase,
   adaptive management strategy should transition towards multi-functional
   management strategy. The core of multi-functional management is to exert
   synergistic effects on the functions and services of grassland
   ecosystems. Such management involves vegetation, soil, livestock,
   environment, economy, and society. Only by optimizing and coupling the
   structure, process, and function of grassland ecosystem and applying
   auxiliary energy input and artificial regulation can the
   multi-functional management be accomplished. The development of
   grassland management practices needs not only strong multidisciplinary
   theoretical support but also robust technical foundation.</td>

   around the world. In particular, the consequences of extreme weather
   events like tornados, heavy rain, and flooding can significantly damage
   built heritage and archeological sites. To face such issues, an
   integrated approach for threat assessment and damage identification is
   of primary importance for managing sites threatened by extreme weather
   events and climate change. This paper presents a holistic approach for
   risk assessment and management, specifically focusing on flooding,
   addressing San Clemente church in Albenga (Northern Italy). Located in
   the Centa riverbed, and dating back to the fifth century, San Clemente
   church has a complex historical stratification that reflects the changes
   that occurred in the area. The integrated approach included the analysis
   of historical, geometrical-dimensional, and meteorological data to
   identify the main threats associated with the site through a modified
   version of the ABC method. In fact, together with the standard
   categories, we added the category Sensitivity to change in order to
   understand the possibility for the archeological site to change without
   adverse impacts on its heritage significance. Starting with identified
   risks, it was possible to define a proper survey strategy to evaluate
   damages caused by flooding. Through the comparison of pre- and
   post-flooding condition of the church, it was possible to analyze the
   damages to the archeological site.</td>

   humanity's greatest challenges. Regions with complex,
   knowledge-intensive farming practices have many components that can be
   adjusted to increase systemic resilience. An argument for the importance
   of evolutionary adaptation pathways is developed with a case-study of
   the viticultural region of the McLaren Vale in South Australia. In a
   series of walk-and-talk interviews, farmers describe their business
   risks and the opportunities to adapt. Their responses suggest a
   sophisticated ecological understanding facilitated by their
   life-experiences, learning networks and relationships with governance,
   research and marketing organisations. In particular, a new exploitation
   of agrobiodiversity is generating on-farm resilience by spreading the
   risks of production and providing opportunities for the region to better
   respond to changing environmental and market conditions. Individual
   farmers have developed unique climate change adaptation pathways, but
   effective cooperation has also enabled the evolution of a regional
   adaptation cluster. Regions such as the McLaren Vale with a path
   dependence of innovation could have a cultural heritage that supports
   attempts at adaptation, which will in turn make them vital first-movers
   in the search for effective responses to climate change risk.</td>

   these terms are mapped onto the terminology of triple-inheritance
   theory, which clarifies how risks arise through the complex interplay of
   social and ecological feedbacks. Studies of past risk, vulnerability and
   resilience are often conducted within a historical ecological framework.
   As both ecological (synchronic) and evolutionary (diachronic)
   understandings of human culture ultimately derive from the same source
   of inspiration - Darwinian evolutionary theory - they are, the authors
   argue, readily integrated. They take steps towards such an integration,

   provides explicit mechanisms for how issues of future vulnerability and

   San Lorenzo (17th to 18th centuries). First of all, in order to support
   the conservation and valorisation of these sites, a characterisation of
   the main construction materials utilized in the building masonries was
   performed together with an analysis of the meteoclimatic conditions in
   their vicinity as provided by monitoring stations recording near-surface
   air temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall amounts. Secondly, the
   same climate variables were analysed in the historical and future
   simulations of a state-of-the-art global climate model, EC-Earth, run at
   high horizontal resolution, and then used with damage functions to make
   projections of deterioration phenomena on the Panamanian heritage sites.
   In particular, we performed an evaluation of the possible surface
   recession, biomass accumulation, and deterioration due to salt
   crystallisation cycles on these sites in the future (by midcentury,
   2039-2068) compared to the recent past (1979-2008), considering a future
   scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Flood is a natural hazard affecting human life and ecosystem globally
   causing catastrophic disasters. Most flood-induced socioeconomic losses
   are exacerbated by unabated urban development, population upsurge,
   unregulated municipal systems, and indiscriminate land use. Therefore,
   implementation of a flood prediction system can potentially help
   mitigate flood-induced consequences. In this study, a framework of
   multi-criteria analysis incorporating geographic information system,
   fuzzy analytic hierarchy process, and bivariate statistics-based methods
   was developed for flood hazard index determination. Flood-prone areas
   were identified based on six factors (hydrological aspects and land
   cover): elevation, aspect, slope, flow accumulation, rainfall, and land
   cover map. To generate a flood hazard index, each one of the factors was
   classified into five categories: very low, low, moderate, high, and very
   high; the factors were then combined and processed using the proposed
   methodology. Obtained overall maps have been adjusted with socioeconomic
   data such as gross domestic product to relate the flood exposure to
   economic and demographic factors in Mombasa County, Kenya. Results
   suggest that the County is largely dominated by areas with a high flood
   hazard index due to its location and shoreline. Fort Jesus, the UNESCO
   World Heritage site, is currently under high risk of flood as shown by
   the flood hazard index, while most of the shoreline is at very high risk
   of flooding.</td>

   ecosystems essential for human well-being. Indonesia and Australia are
   both rich in marine biodiversity. However, there are strong indications
   that marine biodiversity has been deteriorating in Indonesia, Australia
   and globally. Loss of marine diversity is largely as a result of
   conflicting uses of coastal habitats, land-based marine pollution,
   destructive fishing practices, IUU Fishing, overfishing, invasive alien
   marine species, and climate change. This article examines marine
   biodiversity laws in Indonesia and Australia, and In particular it
   examines the implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity,
   1992 (CBD) in domestic legal framework in conservation and sustainable
   use marine biodiversity. The article concludes that laws in Indonesia
   and Australia are in place to conserve and sustainably use marine
   biodiversity but that there are many challenges to effective
   implementation of the legal framework in both countries. While in
   Indonesia the prominent challenge is integrating marine conservation and
   food security, in Australia one of the significant challenges is to

   global average, saltwater intrusion is impacting freshwater supplies and
   food production, and local cultures are being forced to respond. Yap
   State, Federated States of Micronesia (9.5N, 138E), consists of a
   cluster of four main islands (MI) and 14 coral atolls and smaller outer
   islands (OI) spread over 400,000 km2 of ocean. This paper examines three
   aspects of Yap State's adaptive capacity to climate change impacts: 1)
   differences in environmental conditions between the MI and OI; 2)
   relevant features of the MI's cultural heritage; and 3) relevant
   features of OI's cultural heritage, including values and practices
   surrounding the sawei system relationship. Cultural support networks in
   both the MI and OI will almost certainly be relied upon to lessen the
   severity of climate change impacts, perhaps especially as more OI
   residents relocate to the MI. More research is needed to document how
   features of intangible cultural heritage that create and maintain social
   resilience in Yap State will shape residents' adaptive capacity to

   The paper argues that integrating more culturally rooted contributions

   would also test and extend some established practices of climate
   research and policy in anticipating and making futures. The paper

   that follows the 2016 decision by UNESCO to add a traditional cultural
   understanding of the annual seasonal changes in Chinese "intangible
   culture." The calendar year was divided into 24 equal parts (Jieqi) to
   aid agricultural practices. Thus, each Jieqi was associated with
   farming, social, and cultural practices. Given a growing concern with
   the climate in general and a need to adopt environment friendly
   practices, this paper describes the nature of this traditional pattern
   of thought. The paper then proceeds to argue that climate tourism
   products that can create better awareness of man's influences on the
   environment can be developed based on Chinese heritage and practice. For
   sustainable development, the knowledge system of 24 Jieqi climate
   tourism product that promote multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and
   trans-disciplinary communication has been emphasized in this paper. (C)

   statistical dynamics method is developed to estimate typhoon wind hazard
   in the coast of southeast China. The track model includes genesis model,
   movement model, and intensity model. The genesis model is established
   based upon an improved kernel probability density function with the
   biased cross-validation bandwidth. The movement model is developed based
   on the Beta and Advection Model (BAM). The intensity model consists of
   an auto-regression ocean intensity model and an inland decay model using
   the nearest neighbor method. Using the historical environment data, 1000
   years TC tracks are simulated by the improved model and compared with
   features of the historical tracks in the western North Pacific (WNP)
   basin, the results verify that the developed model performs well.
   Moreover, typhoon wind hazard in the coastal areas of southeast China is
   estimated by the improved track model combined with a parametric wind
   field model. Compared with the current Chinese design code, the relative
   differences between estimated return period velocities and those
   recommended in design code are less than 13.4%. The developed model
   enables analyzing typhoon hazard in the context of climate change, which
   is our future task.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The exploitation of river systems for power and navigation has commonly
   been achieved through the installation of a variety of in-channel
   obstacles of which weirs in Britain are amongst the most common. In the
   UK, the historic value of many of these features is recognised by
   planning designations and protection more commonly associated with
   historic buildings and other major monuments. Their construction,
   particularly in the north and west of Britain, has often been associated
   with industries such as textiles, chemicals, and mining, which have
   polluted waterways with heavy metals and other contaminants. The
   construction of weirs altered local channel gradients resulting in
   sedimentation upstream with the potential as well for elevated levels of
   contamination in sediments deposited there. For centuries these weirs
   have remained largely undisturbed, but as a result of the growth in
   hydropower and the drive to improve water quality under the European
   Union's Water Framework Directive, these structures are under increasing
   pressure to be modified or removed altogether. At present, weir
   modifications appear to be considered largely on an individual basis,
   with little focus on the wider impacts this might have on valley floor
   environments. Using a numerical modelling approach, this paper simulates
   the removal of major weirs along a 24-km stretch of the river Derwent,
   Derbyshire, UK, designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The results
   suggest that although removal would not result in significant changes to
   the valley morphology, localised erosion would occur upstream of
   structures as the river readjusts its base level to new boundary
   conditions. Modelling indicates that sediment would also be evacuated
   away from the study area. In the context of the Derwent valley, this
   raises the potential for the remobilisation of contaminants (legacy
   sediments) within the wider floodplain system, which could have
   detrimental, long-term health and environmental implications for the
   river system. Worldwide, rivers have a common association with industry
   being the focus of settlement and development since the earliest
   civilisations with channel engineering a common practice. Therefore, the
   conceptual issues raised by this study have global resonance and are
   particularly important where heritage protection is less robust and
   structures can be removed with little consideration of the environmental
   consequences.</td>

   places outside of the urbanisation impact, creating a narrative that
   both decision-makers and community members start to believe. Hence, the
   role and potential of smaller rural localities is easily forgotten by
   planners, politicians and the public at large. Addressing the scale of
   rural localities in spatial planning, we will first reflect upon the
   main findings from our earlier research project "Finnish rural
   localities in the 2010's" conducted by Lahti University of Applied
   Sciences, the University of Oulu and Aalto University in 2013-2015.
   Findings from the research project affirmed the unfortunate consequences
   of rapid urbanisation, rational blueprint planning and overoptimistic
   expectations of growth in the 1960s and 70s, which have resulted in the
   state of permanent incompleteness in rural localities today. However,
   these localities possess many under-utilised strengths, and we consider
   it essential for the future development of rural localities to make the
   most of this potential, and not only tackle the downwards spiral. This
   requires the ability to engage local stakeholders around a common vision
   for the future, and strategic approach based on endogenous strengths. We
   will discuss these possibilities via two theoretically informed case
   studies. The first one, Vierema, is situated in the region of Northern
   Savo, and the other one, Vaaksy, is the main centre in the municipality
   of Asikkala, situated in the region of Paijat-Hame in Southern Finland.
   Our study design can be characterised as qualitative research benefiting
   from a case study approach, mixed methods research and participatory
   action research. Being critical-emancipatory by nature, the exploratory
   and normative perspectives of Future Studies have also provided
   methodologies to explore future alternative paths and the available, yet
   possibly hidden, resources of people, commodities and skills in new
   ways. Through these case studies, we have identified an urgent need for
   capacity building and preparedness for sustainable resource management
   in Finnish rural localities, including natural and cultural heritage
   protection, climate change management and human well-being. There is a
   need to start thinking creatively 'outside-the-box'and create strategic
   alliances between civil society, business and government, and most
   importantly, between urban and rural areas. Now is the time to start
   innovating a range of policy options and strategic objectives for
   addressing rural localities as places where a sustainable future can be
   developed in Finland.</td>

   providing a variety of ecological services. In the era of traditional
   farming, people created pond systems with ecological wisdom, such as
   Beitang ponds, multi-pond system, mulberry-based dike fish pond, etc.,
   which perform ecological functions including water storage, stormwater
   regulation, pollution purification, micro-climate adjustment, and
   habitat provision. Due to global climate change and human interference,
   problems such as the surface water shortage, water pollution and water
   ecosystem destruction are becoming more and more serious. To deal with
   the changing environment, restore ecology, and construct landscape
   effectively, we not only could be inspired by the natural pond system,
   but also need to learn from the traditional cultural heritage, such as
   the ecological wisdom of the various pond systems. The multi-functional
   dike pond system plays an important role in dealing with the
   environmental changes and optimizing the ecological services. On the
   basis of clarifying the composition, structure and function of ponds in
   nature, this article explores the ecological wisdom of the pond systems
   in traditional villages, taking the design and practices of the Three
   Gorges Reservoir as an example to discuss the application of the
   multi-functional dike pond in the ecological restoration and landscape
   optimization of the hydro-fluctuation belt with seasonal water level
   fluctuation.</td>

   meant the driving force for local and even national development. This
   recognition brought a series of legal protection measures which,
   however, did not take into account the urban and environmental
   development of the city and other urban plans developed in parallel.
   Focusing on four selected case studies in the Caribbean, this article
   analyzes the challenges that those cities face in the 21st century and
   also the link between the historic center protection plans and the urban
   and environmental plans of the global city, which transversally affect
   the preservation of their cultural properties. For this, through the
   review of legal-administrative documentation and planning from the legal
   regime, the article confronts aspects of the management of the four
   declared colonial cities with the city's overall urban and environmental
   situation (environmental quality, Climate change, sanitation,
   communications and transport, urban tourism, etc.) with the aim of
   proposing joint actions that integrate the Cultural Heritage management
   in the whole strategy of urban regeneration in a more transversal way.
   In turn, these joint actions are compared with the general solutions
   posed by the current Caribbean Action Plan for World Heritage
   (2015-2019) to improve the heritage management in historical centers.
   The article concludes with a series of proposals to improve the cultural
   heritage management of these cities and the preservation of their
   exceptional universal values.</td>

   spectacular geo-archaeological landscape that lead to its inscription as
   World Heritage Site in 1985. Petra is also a fragile site facing a wide
   diversity of risks, ranging from those posed by environmental factors as
   well as those attributed to tourism. In recent years, hazardous natural
   phenomena were registered as increasingly impacting the site, and most
   specifically the 'Siq', a 1.2 km naturally formed gorge serving as the
   only tourist entrance to the archaeological park, posing a major threat
   to cultural heritage and visitors. These recent events have prompted
   UNESCO Amman Office, in cooperation with the national authorities, to
   develop a strategy towards prevention and mitigation of instability
   phenomena at the 'Siq' and, thus, further contribute to the management
   and conservation of the site through the implementation of the
   multi-year Italian funded "Siq Stability" project Actions have been
   primarily focusing on the analysis of the stability conditions of the
   'Siq' slopes, the installation of an integrated monitoring system and
   the definition and implementation of mitigation measures against rock
   instability. This paper reports a detailed description of the integrated
   monitoring system installed paying particular attention on the wireless
   monitoring devices and the EASA applications, which proved to be some of
   the most successful systems implemented in the framework of the project.
   Some preliminary results regarding the data retrieved, policies applied
   and actions taken to ensure long-term sustainability and capacity
   development of the national authorities are also reported.</td>

   urban centers is growing. Climate change is one of the challenges of
   this century and it is having a great impact on the society and economy
   of cities and buildings. According to climate change scenarios cities
   will have to face frequent extreme events in the future years, like
   droughts, heat waves, abundant precipitations or snowfalls. However,
   there are little studies that try to analyze the effects from different
   points of view and to find a solution that can have an impact on
   buildings, the town environment as well as on the well being of the
   society. Therefore this article proposes a complex assessment and
   intervention strategy based on the case study of Oravita, a small
   mountain town from the western part of Romania, that will improve the
   resilience of the town trough a multidisciplinary approach. The aim is
   to understand and to adapt the historic town to the contemporary
   climatic needs by an interdisciplinary holistic understanding of the
   context through different professional views: architectural, landscape
   architecture, historical, engineering, social, economical and
   geographical.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Lake Tana Sub-basin has a splendid plenty of nature that should be
   conserved for future generations and not be spoiled. One effort toward
   its protection is the establishment of The Lake Tana Biosphere Reserve,
   Ethiopia's fourth natural heritage site established by UNESCO, after
   Simien National Park, Lower Valley of the Omo and Lower Valley of the
   Awash. However trend analysis shows that a significant change is taking
   place in the climate of the region at the same time that growing
   population increases pressure for agricultural expansion and
   development, and industrial activities to meet growing food and energy
   demands. Although policies exist that could help protect the catchment's
   resources, policy gaps, institutional problems and low policy
   implementation limit policy effectiveness. The major problems in the
   area can be summarized into three: Firstly, the policies and strategies
   are too general and do not give adequate direction/guideline to those
   who are implementing them. Secondly, even when there are laws that could
   be implemented, there are cases where there are no institutions or
   capable institutions that implement them. Thirdly, there are overlapping
   and, sometimes contradicting objectives of different institutions and
   hence there is little cooperation and coordination among different
   institutions. These gaps need to be addressed in order to manage and use
   natural resources in a sustainable manner. This chapter presents the key
   environmental trends in the region, and reviews vulnerabilities,
   threats, policies, and environmental protection gaps, in addition to
   potentially researchable thematic areas.</td>

   history of humanity. The most relevant masterpieces of such human
   history have been included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. These
   sites and their associated remains are not always in equilibrium with
   the environment. They are continuously impacted and weathered by a
   variety of internal and external factors, both natural and
   human-induced, with rapid and/or slow onset. These include major sudden
   natural hazards, such as earthquakes or extreme meteorological events,
   but also slow cumulative processes such as the erosion of rocks,
   compounded by the effects of climate change, as well as the role of
   humans, especially in conflict situations. Many rupestrian sites have
   been carved into soft rock, generally with UCS &lt; 25 MPa (ISRM in Int J
   Rock Mech Min Sci Geomech Abs 18:85-110, 1981), in vertical cliffs, and
   show major conservation issues in the domain of rock slope stability and
   rock weathering. This paper reports the experience of rock fall
   mitigation in rupestrian sites, mainly from the UNESCO World Heritage
   List (Bamiyan in Afghanistan; Lalibela in Ethiopia; Petra in Jordan,
   Vardzia in Georgia and others). The general approach, implemented in the
   activities, includes a very detailed interdisciplinary study, with the
   objective to understand degradation processes and causative factors,
   followed, as a subsequent step, by proper field conservation work. The
   latter is mainly related to re-discovering and potential application of
   traditional knowledge and sustainable practices, and is primarily based
   on local conservation techniques.</td>

   them derives directly from climate changes and generates a deep impact
   on cultural heritages. As a result, the need for solutions able to cope
   with uncertain weather conditions and increased natural disasters is
   getting urgent. STORM is a European Research and Innovation Action
   co-funded in the H2020 framework that is aimed at creating intelligent
   tools which will gather data from libraries, sensors and crowd-sensing
   techniques in order to enable cultural heritage stakeholders (e.g., the
   organisations which have to manage the sites) to implement the most
   appropriate actions in the prevention, response and recovery phases of
   emergencies which could impact on cultural heritages. More specifically,
   the project aims at addressing those risks deriving from climate change,
   which in the near future is going to worsen most of the present hazards,
   as flash floods, heat waves and forest fires. As such, the approach
   adopted by the project is particularly fit for the purpose of being
   integrated with smart city systems which are increasingly growing in
   number and variety. Even if safety issues are not considered central in
   the overall concept of smart city, it's plain that the huge quantity of
   data that can be gathered and processed in any future STORM-like urban
   cultural heritage compound should feed into the available smart city
   systems. On the other way round, the mass of data produced or processed
   by smart city systems have the potential to impact dramatically on
   emergency management and prevention activities to be implemented by
   cultural heritage stakeholders. The paper will illustrate the approach
   that the STORM project is adopting to mitigate the impact of climate
   changes on cultural heritages and the mutual benefits which could derive
   from an integration of the STORM outcomes with smart cities systems
   through the use of standard emergency data exchange protocols and an
   integrated framework aimed at improving existing processes related to
   the three identified areas: Prevention, Response and Policy.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Abstract: The State of Michoacan, as well as a handful of other hot spot
   regions worldwide, harbors an outstanding overlap between natural and
   cultural richness as a result of intermingle climatic geological,
   geographical and ecological conditions. Presently both, natural and
   cultural heritages are jeopardized at most hot spots worldwide and
   policy makers seek urgently for robust base line information to restore
   and eventually reorient development. Spatially explicit base line data
   bases have been recognized as critical in order to facilitate design and
   implementation of public policies. In this sense, dynamics of native
   land cover/vegetation patterns (natural units) have helped in enormously
   to provide base line information and predict outcomes. A rather critical
   issue relies in developing replicable and robust methods to predict
   natural units, as a direct response of climatic, geological and
   geomorphological data (physical units). Often natural units are used as
   spatial criteria to delineate physical units, yet these latter are
   regarded as the responsible variables for delimiting natural units. This
   tautological thought has been largely neglected in most scientific
   literature in Mexico when constructing cartographic outputs. In this
   article, we argue that native land cover/vegetation patterns are the
   response variable of physical attributes at a meso-scale level. Hence,
   the objective of this investigation was to predict native land
   cover/vegetation patterns based upon climatic, geological,
   geomorphological and ecological attributes hierarchically intermingled.
   The contribution was made in order to developing a robust and replicable
   method accordingly to current available information worldwide. The
   research took place in Michoacan state as it is regarded a typical
   hotspot comprising geo-ecological complex features. To illustrate this
   further, Michoacan harbors over 800 tree species which overpasses the
   number of species of all Western Europe. Prediction modeling was with
   the aid of a geographic information system. Decisions rules were based
   upon Boolean logic giving special attention to emerging bioclimatic
   zoning techniques. The later consists in providing gradients of
   temperature and precipitation along seasonal threshold values so that
   sound matching between physical and natural units is found. In addition,
   an innovative aspect regards the cartographic expression of these
   gradients of temperature and precipitation here referred as termotype
   and ombrotypes respectively. Outcomes demonstrated that prediction of
   native land cover/vegetation patterns was feasible within a
   geo-ecologically complex region as Michoacan. In addition, dissecting
   attributes of the landscape hierarchically organized proved to be a
   robust and replicable method to reconstruct native vegetation patterns
   at places currently covered by anthropogenic activities. Tropical
   seasonally dry forests covers most surface still covers most surface
   (28.52% of the State), whereas, temperate forests cover the second most
   abundant types (27.71% of the State). Aquatic vegetation (0.22% of the
   State), and Xerophytic scrubland (0.08% of the State), are currently the
   least represented types. The prediction modeling indicated that tropical
   seasonally dry forests has been depleted in 18.68% of the State, while
   temperate forests in 14.98% of the State. Ecotones delimiting tropical
   seasonally dry and temperate forests are under drastic threat because
   two mayor productive systems are gaining global importance. Avocado and
   Mango produced at these regions are expanding their ranges as a result
   of global demands. In consequence our current findings may serve to
   reorient policy makers in order to find tradeoffs and thresholds to
   conciliate encroachment of productive systems and maintenance of
   environmental services provided by native land cover/vegetation
   patterns. To conclude, native land cover/vegetation patterns were
   predicted as a response variable of physical attributes so that
   tautological thinking was avoided. The method developed may be applied
   to other hot spots provided that physical information is available. A
   practical outcome regard the obtained land cover/vegetation map, which
   may serve as baseline to predict future scenarios in the light of
   current man-made and climatic changes foreseen.</td>

   culturales y naturales destacable que se entrelazan entre condiciones
   geol&oacute;gicas, geogr&aacute;ficas y ecol&oacute;gicas. Este patrimonio natural y cultural
   est&aacute; hoy d&iacute;a amenazado, por ende, los tomadores de decisiones buscan
   informaci&oacute;n de l&iacute;nea base para restaurar y reorientar las acciones de
   desarrollo. El objetivo de este art&iacute;culo, por tanto, fue predecir los
   patrones de cubierta vegetal oriunda a trav&eacute;s de un m&eacute;todo replicable.
   La predicci&oacute;n se bas&oacute; en atributos clim&aacute;ticos, geol&oacute;gicos,
   geomorfol&oacute;gicos y ecol&oacute;gicos, jer&aacute;rquicamente yuxtapuestos a trav&eacute;s de
   un sistema de informaci&oacute;n geogr&aacute;fica (SIG). Las reglas de decisi&oacute;n se
   basaron en l&oacute;gica booleana dando &eacute;nfasis a la zonificaci&oacute;n
   bioclimatol&oacute;gica. La predicci&oacute;n de la cubierta vegetal oriunda mostr&oacute;
   que los bosques estacionales tropicales cubren la mayor superficie,
   mientras que la vegetaci&oacute;n acu&aacute;tica es la menos representada. Para
   concluir, los atributos que delimitan el paisaje, jer&aacute;rquicamente
   organizados, probaron ser un m&eacute;todo robusto y replicable para
   reconstruir los patrones de la cubierta vegetal oriunda, actualmente en
   &aacute;reas de cobertura antropog&eacute;nica. Este resultado, expresado en un mapa,
   servir&aacute; como l&iacute;nea base para predecir los escenarios futuros a la luz de

   criterion of risk, created to assess the flood risk of the international
   heritage building. In order to evaluate this criterion, it was applied
   to a sample of Portuguese building heritage.Design/methodology/approach
   - This effort will start with the definition of the most important
   historical buildings in Portugal, its location and a full study about
   its constitution considering not only the materials they are made to but
   also the layers and the influence of the porosity/porometry for the
   drying process. Then it will also crucial the classification of the
   flood risk occurrence having in mind the previous information. A mapping
   will be made with the classification here developed.Findings - This work
   presents a critical review of the main information related with the
   Portuguese monuments classified as "National Monuments". A new empirical
   model was proposed takes into account all of the factors defined as the
   most influent in flood risk determination. A risk map was created on the
   basis classification developed. It will be possible to observe that a
   significant amount of Portuguese monuments are classified as medium to
   high risk of flooding.Originality/value - This paper presents a new
   methodology to analyse the flood risk of international heritage
   building. The main benefit of the work is that it discusses the
   importance architectural heritage and justifies the need to safeguard it
   from extreme climatic phenomena such as floods.</td>

   phenomena and natural processes, social and economic environment. Due to
   influence of climate change, such extreme hydrological phenomena will be
   more frequent. Destructive nature of water effects can cause human
   casualties, evacuation and damage to the environment; it can seriously
   endanger economic development and undermine economic activities.
   Therefore, maintaining of natural and economic balance must be primary
   goal which requires integrated approach to flood management. The latest
   flood events in Europe and especially catastrophic natural disaster in
   Serbia in 2014 lead us to conclusion that it is feasible and necessary
   to reduce risk of flood by practical combinations of measures in
   relation to the scope of disaster and degree of exposure to community.
   In this regard, one needs clear understanding of existing and potential
   flood risks in order to determine preventive reduction measures which
   represent approach to flood management. This work, on the occasion of
   increasingly frequent large scale of floods in Serbia and neighbouring
   countries in 2014, suggests that human responsibility and natural
   solutions are the best way to reduce the consequences of floods.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>At first glance, the terms heritage and climate change appear to travel
   in opposite directions. Heritage is concerned with conserving the past,
   while climate change is about conserving the future. This paper tackles
   this temporal cross-roads by examining a tourist attraction that
   transforms modern, consumer culture into heritage in the form of a
   fast-tracked lost civilisation beneath the sea. Museo Subaquatico De
   Arte is a sunken sculpture museum in the Caribbean Sea that inaugurates
   a unique way of restoring the distressed habitats of the Meso-American
   Reef System, while offering a sobering glimpse into a world that asks
   tourists to consider 'what have we done?' Visitors are invited to
   examine their own way of life as both precarious and implicated in
   climate changed futures by confronting them with an Atlantis-like
   eeriness that both reflects and portends the closure of the tumultuous
   Anthropocene. The experience promotes the immediacy of the present by
   concretising life-sized caricatures of consumer culture beneath the sea,
   bequeathing these to an aquatic environment that soon transforms them
   into a state of decaying modernity. This promotes a theatre for radical
   change as these caricatures, and by extension we, are overtaken by this
   environment and destined to a diminutive state.</td>

   threatening societies worldwide, posing significant challenges for the
   scientific community as well as for policy makers and planners in
   understanding and assessing drivers, dynamics and risks associated to
   these phenomena. Floods events, recognized as one of the most
   threatening water-related disasters, can affect people's lives as well
   as their properties. In recent years, the number of flood events is
   growing as a consequence of many factors, both climatic, such as the
   dramatic intensification of the pattern of precipitations, and
   non-climatic, such as the change in land use, the increase of
   population, the presence of relevant human activities in hazard-prone
   areas and, more general, the uncontrolled urban development. Recent
   river flooding events in Europe urge the design and implementation of
   proper flood risk prevention strategies in order to protect society and
   the environment, and mitigate the impact of these events. The European
   Flood Directive (FD) 2007/60/EC represents a specific and innovative
   legislative framework to support the development of these management
   strategies, in order to reduce the adverse consequences imposed by
   floods to selected targets. In this context, the recent KULTURisk-FP7
   Project developed a state-of-the-art Regional Risk Assessment (RRA)
   methodology to assess the risk related to flood events. The
   KULTURisk-RRA methodology, comprehensively presented in Ronco et al.
   (2014) and based on the concept of risk being a function of hazard,
   exposure and vulnerability, has been applied to the Sihl River valley in
   Switzerland through a tuning process considering the site-specific
   context and features (Ronco et al. 2015). Flood related risks have been
   assessed for different targets (namely people, economic activities,
   natural and semi-natural systems and cultural heritage) lying on the
   Sihl river valley, including the city of Zurich, which represents a
   typical case of river flooding in urban areas. The main outputs of the
   RRA methodology application are GIS-based risk maps that allow for the
   identification and prioritization of relative hotspots and targets at
   risk. By means of Multi Criteria Deci sion Analysis tools, the so-called
   total risk maps have been produced to visualize the spatial distribution
   of flood risk within the study area through a tailored participative
   approach by eliciting feedbacks from expert and local stakeholders. In
   particular, the total risk map produced for a 300 year return period
   scenario (selected as reference) demonstrates that the Sihl river valley
   is generally affected by a relatively low risk, where higher relative
   risks are concentrated in the deeply urbanized area around the Zurich
   city centre. Finally, results of the testing of the KR-RRA methodology
   in a real case study have confirmed its overall consistency,
   appropriateness and relevance to the specific needs of the region and
   the objectives posed by the EU Flood directive.</td>

   of Ghent University undertake field surveys to the Altai Region in
   Siberia, Russia. This region is a very important archaeological heritage
   area in the world. Scattered throughout the region are hundreds of
   frozen tombs, ritual monuments and petroglyphs. Research of these relics
   helps to understand the life of Eurasian nomads in the 4th century BC.
   Even more important, due to upcoming touristic activities and climate
   change, the documentation of the frozen tombs is imperative. A
   traditional archaeological survey consists out of a basic description, a
   drawing, one or two pictures and the GNSS location of each monument.
   With support of the department of Geography several topographical maps
   are created based on satellite images (IKONOS, Pleiades) and measurement
   of Ground Control Points (GCP) on site. Furthermore, since 2012 the use
   of 3D realistic photo modelling is being applied to survey the monuments
   in higher detail. The method of photo modelling proves to be successful
   and cost-effective. Besides their high detail, the almost real-life
   virtual representation of the monuments makes these techniques less
   abstract than a traditional archaeological survey. During the field
   campaigns in the summer of 2014 and 2015 this method was implied to
   record hundreds of monuments in the valley of Turu Alty (Siberia,
   Russia). Using 3D modelling software the models are created to document
   the monuments and petroglyphs of the study area for research and
   conservational purposes.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The ephemerality of the built environment exists through a multitude of
   lenses and questions the presumed need for traditional trajectories of
   preservation and longevity. Established processes tend to focus on
   ephemerality in terms of growth and decay, responsiveness and
   interaction, or as visual or phenomenological qualities. The concept of
   ephemerality is directly confronted in the duality of two media decaying
   or evolving at varied rates within the environment and is particularly
   evident along the Louisiana Gulf Coast as land loss, settlement, and
   culture overlap in a continuous tete-a-tete between biotic processes and
   the built environment. New methodologies of representation, analysis,
   and preservation must be developed to address issues of ephemerality
   within sites of cultural heritage and/or ecological significance. This
   need is hastened as global climate change identifies coastal edges
   dramatically altering in the present and near future.To investigate
   these methodologies, we selected Fort Proctor, a National Register of
   Historic Places (NRHP) site at extreme environmental risk. Fort Proctor
   is one of several forts built in southeastern Louisiana following the
   War of 1812, and it has remained in a fluctuating landscape as a static
   marker or datum, recording major ecological changes within the dynamic
   coastal environment. This essay will discuss the new procedural
   methodology authored for the preservation of ephemeral sites at extreme
   environmental risk.</td>

   application of innovative and non-invasive monitoring techniques for
   developing complete and detailed projects. The demand of cost-effective
   and rapid tools promoting long-term strategies for cultural heritage
   promotion and risk assessment is, therefore, urgent. These issues become
   indeed of paramount importance in the case of very large areas, such as
   the coastal ones, where the landscape morphoevolution - driven by
   climate changes - and the landscape modification - due to agricultural
   and industrial activities - have dramatically increased the exposure
   risk of Cultural Heritage. In such a framework, traditional monitoring
   methodologies appear impracticable. This is the reason why the MeTIBas
   (Italian acronym for Innovative Methods and Technologies for the
   Cultural Heritage in the Basilicata region) project has been developed.
   MeTIBas aims to develop an innovative geoarchaeological investigation
   approach for large areas (implementation of a Territorial Information
   System, drawing-up of an experimental digital geoarchaeological map, and
   creation of an open geoarchaeological database). MeTIBas has been
   developed in the coastal area of Metaponto, which roughly coincides with
   the ancient territory of the Greek settlement of Metapontum and its
   chora and includes a region of about 400 km(2) in the Ionian sector of
   the Basilicata region (southern Italy). The data integration and joint
   analysis of the huge amount of MeTIBas heterogeneous data have been
   conveniently carried out in a GIS environment, thus allowing an
   effective combination of the information from different cognitive
   levels. Besides, the adoption of a Web GIS environment (a Geoplatform
   operating in Open Source Framework for Rich Web GIS Applications
   performed by geoSDI; www.geosdi.org) allows a wide dissemination of the
   information structured in the MeTIBas project.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The paper discusses geographical characteristics of Slovenia from the
   perspective of tourism development and presents main processes that have
   marked it in the last decades. Tourism has significantly affected the
   appearance as well as economic and social structure of many Slovenian
   regions. The paper focuses on the role of various factors, which
   influenced, tourist attraction of Slovenia and its regions, as well as
   on changes in tourism supply and demand in the last decades and their
   relation to some of the political and economic events.Recently, Slovenia
   has experienced an above-average rate of tourism growth. Several of the
   nation-state's geopolitical decisions impacted the growth of the tourism
   economy: Slovenia became a member of the European Union (EU) and the
   North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) (2004), introduced the Euro as
   the national currency (2007) and became a full member of the Schengen
   Space (2009). However, impacts of these changes were not comparable to
   the impacts of political and economic disruptions, related to the
   disintegration of Yugoslavia, which caused drastic decline in foreign
   tourists' numbers at the beginning of the 1990s.Despite long-term growth
   trends, tourism in Slovenia is already facing many challenges (e.g.,
   unreliable snow cover in the winter season in Alpine resorts as a result
   of the climate change impacts). Moreover, the growth of tourism has
   caused some environmental and social problems (or at least contributed
   to them) in those areas where tourism development has been the most
   intensive. Nevertheless, impacts of tourism have been rather limited.
   One of the important reasons why, so far, tourism has not caused any
   large-scale environmental or social problems is the fact that Slovenia
   has not developed real mass tourism. In the European context, Slovenia
   remains an only moderately developed tourist destination. Due to the
   growing competition on the global tourism market a continuous adaptation
   to the changing tourism demand is of crucial importance, taking into
   account not just short-term gains, but especially tourism sector's
   long-term viability. From this perspective, also sustainable tourism
   principles should be considered more relevant.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Climate change will affect not only natural and cultural resources
   within protected areas but also tourism and visitation patterns. The
   U.S. National Park Service systematically collects data regarding its
   270+ million annual recreation visits, and therefore provides an
   opportunity to examine how human visitation may respond to climate
   change from the tropics to the polar regions. To assess the relationship
   between climate and park visitation, we evaluated historical monthly
   mean air temperature and visitation data (1979-2013) at 340 parks and
   projected potential future visitation (2041-2060) based on two
   warming-climate scenarios and two visitation-growth scenarios. For the
   entire park system a third-order polynomial temperature model explained
   69% of the variation in historical visitation trends. Visitation
   generally increased with increasing average monthly temperature, but
   decreased strongly with temperatures  25&deg;C. Linear to polynomial monthly
   temperature models also explained historical visitation at individual
   parks (R2 0.12-0.99, mean = 0.79, median = 0.87). Future visitation at
   almost all parks (95%) may change based on historical temperature,
   historical visitation, and future temperature projections.
   Warming-mediated increases in potential visitation are projected for
   most months in most parks (67&amp;#8211;77% of months; range across future
   scenarios), resulting in future increases in total annual visits across
   the park system (8&amp;#8211;23%) and expansion of the visitation season at
   individual parks (13&amp;#8211;31 days). Although very warm months at some
   parks may see decreases in future visitation, this potential change
   represents a relatively small proportion of visitation across the
   national park system. A changing climate is likely to have cascading and
   complex effects on protected area visitation, management, and local
   economies. Results suggest that protected areas and neighboring
   communities that develop adaptation strategies for these changes may be
   able to both capitalize on opportunities and minimize detriment related
   to changing visitation.</td>

   begin to address this knowledge gap. A summary of research activities
   over the past [approximately]4 years is presented here. Results to date
   suggest that responses of highly migratory tunas and billfishes are
   likely to be species-specific. Temperate species such as Atlantic
   bluefin tuna are potentially most vulnerable. In order to estimate
   future trends in recruitment, an understanding of the basic ecology of
   early life history stages is vital, but has frequently been neglected in
   previous research. Collaborations across disciplines between ecologists,

   performance objective for future management of U.S. Department of the
   Interior (DOI) lands and resources in response to global change.
   Vulnerability assessments can inform climate adaptation planning by
   providing insight into what natural resources are most at risk and why.
   Three components of vulnerability-exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive
   capacity-were defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC) as necessary for identifying climate adaptation strategies and
   actions. In 2011, the DOI requested all internal bureaus report ongoing
   or completed vulnerability assessments about a defined range of
   assessment targets or climate-related threats. Assessment targets were
   defined as freshwater resources, landscapes and wildlife habitat, native
   and cultural resources, and ocean health. Climate-related threats were
   defined as invasive species, wildfire risk, sea-level rise, and melting
   ice and permafrost. Four hundred and three projects were reported, but
   the original DOI survey did not specify that information be provided on
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity collectively as part of the
   request, and it was unclear which projects adhered to the framework
   recommended by the IPCC. Therefore, the U.S. Geological Survey National
   Climate Change and Wildlife Science Center conducted a supplemental
   survey to determine how frequently each of the three vulnerability
   components was assessed. Information was categorized for 124 of the 403
   reported projects (30.8 percent) based on the three vulnerability
   components, and it was discovered that exposure was the most common
   component assessed (87.9 percent), followed by sensitivity (68.5
   percent) and adaptive capacity (33.1 percent). The majority of projects
   did not fully assess vulnerability; projects focused on
   landscapes/wildlife habitats and sea-level rise were among the minority
   that simultaneously addressed all three vulnerability components. To
   maintain consistency with the IPCC definition of vulnerability, DOI may
   want to focus initial climate adaptation planning only on the outcomes
   of studies that comprehensively address vulnerability as inclusive of
   exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Although the present study
   results are preliminary and used an unstructured survey design, they
   illustrate the importance of a comprehensive and consistent
   vulnerability definition and of using information on vulnerability
   components in DOI surveys to ensure relevant data are used to identify
   adaptation options.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Under the influence of global climate change, the risk preparedness has
   become a universal issue in different research fields. In the
   conservation of cultural heritage, disaster risk management is becoming
   one of the major research topics. Besides researches on the theory and
   mechanism of disaster risk management, the tools for the performance of
   site managers to protect cultural heritage is another important issue
   that needs development.UNESCO and ICOMOS have released some important
   documents on disaster risk management including its concept,
   identification, evaluation, mitigation, monitoring and resilience, etc.
   However, there is a big gap between concept and implementation in
   Taiwan. Presently there are 2000 monuments in Taiwan that hardly meet
   the modern code. First, based on international documents released, this
   research presents 13 disaster indicators on monuments and their
   environments. Next, 345 monuments in northern Taiwan are taken as
   examples to evaluate their risk situations with indicators designed in
   2011. Some positive recommendations were given at the same time. As a
   result, a comparative evaluation was completed in 2012 and some key
   issues are found, such as too many electrical facilities, lack of
   efficient firefighting equipment, and a shortage of management
   mechanism, just to name a few. Through the improvement of the
   management, some major risk can be mitigated. In 201314, this research
   took 23 national monuments from the 345 monuments to evaluate their risk
   situations and compare the differences between national and local
   monuments. Results show that almost all management mechanisms in the
   national monuments have been established and are running well. However,
   problems like inappropriate electrical facilities and insufficient
   monitoring equipment remain. In addition, the performance of private
   monuments is not as good as public ones. Based on the collected
   information and evaluation, this research develops safety measures of
   heritage conservation in two aspects. One is for researchers to measure
   the risk of the heritage; the other is for site managers to manage the
   risk of their monument with ease. In conclusion, intendants of monuments
   in Taiwan have to develop more disaster risk management ideas to
   mitigate and prevent risks. In the meantime, the management and
   monitoring mechanisms available are helpful tools for risk mitigation.
   The awareness and training of the site managers are important issues for
   the implementation of risk prevention.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The ponds for retting the hemp (Cannabis sativa) are typical artificial
   ecosystems of the Eastern part of the Po River plain. They were built in
   the past centuries and abandoned after World War Two. Now in the
   province of Ferrara (Italy) there are about 1420 ponds still remaining.
   They are used as water storage for irrigation, for the drainage of
   excessive water from the cultivated fields or they are completely
   abandoned. They have great importance as cultural heritage and as
   "stepping stones" for the water fauna and flora inside the ecological
   networks.In 2009, the Ecological Station of the Natural History Museum
   of Ferrara started a sampling program of the invertebrate fauna, which
   was collected with a 1 mm mesh net in 63 ponds. The presence of aquatic
   Vertebrate species and 17 environmental variables were also recorded.
   The environmental data of 47 ponds were analyzed by a cluster analysis.
   A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was performed on the
   presence/absence data of the fauna, together with the environmental
   variables characterizing each pond. The most influent parameter resulted
   to be the presence or the absence of a connection to the network of the
   surface channels, made of about 4200 km of canals used for both the
   water drainage and the agricultural watering. The ponds connected to the
   freshwater network, that receives water from the Po River, are invaded
   by alien species, whilst the most precious species (autochthonous
   gastropods, water beetles, amphibians and reptiles) prefer the ponds not
   connected to the channel network.However it resulted that, when a pond
   is surrounded by a large, not exploited strip, with a well developed
   terrestrial vegetation with a relatively high number of species, some
   important native species can coexist with alien species even in ponds
   that communicate with the channel network.Some interesting species were
   recorded, such as Gyraulus laevis and G. acronicus, two gastropods that
   are vulnerable to extinction in some European countries. Two species of
   water beetles, Hygrotus decoratus and Copelatus haemorroidalis, new to
   the province of Ferrara, were collected. It was possible to list both
   the native species which can cope high trophic levels and the
   coexistence with invasive alien species and, on the other side, the
   native species with higher ecological requirements. The ponds have
   proved to be highly sensitive to global climate change effects.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The Last Mountain is a 2011 Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC)
   film. It examines an aggressive form of strip mining in West Virginia
   known as mountaintop removal (MTR). The Last Mountain was the first of
   more than 40 MTR films to be distributed nationally and, as such, marks
   the entry of the issue onto the political scene in the USA. This essay
   analyses the film's use of environmental melodrama to define the
   problems related to MTR and create identification between victims of MTR
   and viewers. However, the latter portion of the film attempts to scale
   up from the melodramatic depiction of MTR to advocacy on broader issues
   regarding renewable energy and global climate change. In doing so, the
   film breaks with melodramatic form, draining its emotional power,
   foreclosing systemic political action, and limiting its overall
   effectiveness as a sustainability narrative. Copyright (C) 2014

   bacteria is a topic of increasing concern for coastal ecosystems,
   including the Chesapeake Bay. Surface water temperature trends in the
   Bay indicate a warming pattern of roughly 0.3-0.4&deg;C per decade over the
   past 30 years. It is unclear what impact future warming will have on
   pathogens currently found in the Bay, including Vibrio spp. Using
   historical environmental data, combined with three different statistical
   models of Vibrio vulnificus probability, we explore the relationship
   between environmental change and predicted Vibrio vulnificus presence in
   the upper Chesapeake Bay. We find that the predicted response of V.
   vulnificus probability to high temperatures in the Bay differs
   systematically between models of differing structure. As existing
   publicly available datasets are inadequate to determine which model
   structure is most appropriate, the impact of climatic change on the
   probability of V. vulnificus presence in the Chesapeake Bay remains
   uncertain. This result points to the challenge of characterizing climate
   sensitivity of ecological systems in which data are sparse and only
   statistical models of ecological sensitivity exist.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The development of mass tourism has posed threats and created problems
   that have affected destinations and local communities in virtually every
   corner of the world. To overcome the problems of mass tourism, many
   governments, businesses, communities, and tourism organizations have
   turned to alternative types of tourism development. One such alternative
   is 'special interest tourism'. While this has become a centre of
   attention for the tourism industry, in academic and professional
   literature, there is still much that is not known or is not widely
   known.The present paper underlines the necessity of internationally
   monitoring the ecological state of our planet,developed societies have
   to assume, based on their material and intelligence resources, the main
   part of the obligations of developing countries, which are forced to
   channel their efforts towards other priorities in order to respond to
   their most stringent necessities. Their support might help all the
   states to wisely advance and we refer here to both industrialization
   process and environment protection. On the one hand, an unpolluted
   environment is vital for tourism sector within the EU; the community
   politics for environmental protection is relevant for tourism and make
   reference to water quality, reduction of air pollution or improvement of
   urban environment quality. Post-crisis challenge for Romania is the
   organization and development of its natural and cultural resources in a
   range of tourism products with a wide appeal to the public, and
   transforming these attractions in a flow of tourists and benefits for
   the country.This requires an integrated product development and
   strategic marketing approach, and more attention to the environmental
   problems and sustainable development of tourism and environment. This
   study uses a framework developed from the industrial ecology literature
   to assess the impacts of the tourism industry on the environment. The
   greening of tourism, which involves efficiency improvements in energy,
   water, and waste systems, is expected to reinforce the employment
   potential of the sector with increased local hiring and sourcing and
   significant opportunities in tourism oriented toward local culture and
   the natural environment. Green tourism embraces all aspects of
   sustainable tourism, based on four basic principles(1) (UNWTO):
   environmental, social, economic and climate (i.e. the "quadruple bottom
   line" of sustainable tourism). Green tourism minimizes the environmental
   impact of tourism and maximizes its adaptation to climate
   change.However, educational efforts geared towards industry sectors seem
   most effective when cost savings and the marketing benefits of "being
   green" (2)are emphasized in this article.</td>

   and the burdened cultural heritage of Europe is particularly vulnerable
   to be left unprotected. Climate for Culture(2) project exploits the
   damage impact of climate change on cultural heritage at regional scale.
   In this paper the progress of the study with in situ measurements and
   investigations at cultural heritage sites throughout Europe combined
   with laboratory simulations is described. Cultural works of art are
   susceptible to deterioration with environmental changes causing
   imperceptibly slow but steady accumulation of damaging effects directly
   impacted on structural integrity. Laser holographic interference method
   is employed to provide remote non destructive field-wise detection of
   the structural differences occurred as climate responses. The first
   results from climate simulation of South East Europe ( Crete) are
   presented. A full study in regards to the four climate regions of Europe
   is foreseen to provide values for development of a precise and
   integrated model of thermographic building simulations for evaluation of
   impact of climate change.Development of a third generation user
   interface software optimised portable metrology system (DHSPI II) is
   designed to record in custom intervals the surface of materials
   witnessing reactions under simulated climatic conditions both on-field
   and in laboratory. The climate conditions refer to real data-loggers
   readings representing characteristic historical building in selected
   climate zones. New generation impact sensors termed Glass Sensors and
   Free Water Sensors are employed in the monitoring procedure to
   cross-correlate climate data with deformation data. In this paper
   results from the combined methodology are additionally presented.</td>

   overview of this special issue titled "Municipalities addressing climate
   change: a case study of Norway". It provides the rationale for the
   project leading to the special issue while summarizing the issue's
   contents and outcomes.Design/methodology/approach - Seven research
   institutes in Norway were brought together for a five-year project
   examining adaptation to extreme weather in Norway at the municipal
   level.Findings - The project led to individual and collaborative
   research linked to policy advice for Norwegian municipalities. Barriers
   and opportunities to act locally regarding extreme weather were
   identified, giving ways forward through more science along with policy
   and action possibilities.Research limitations/implications - Only three
   main sectors were covered: drinking water supply, cultural heritage, and
   flood risk reduction. Extreme weather affects other sectors too, but no
   advice is given regarding those areas.Practical implications - The
   project led to fact sheets, a web site, and engagement with
   practitioners at the municipal level in two ways. First, providing
   science-based advice that can be used by those working for
   municipalities. Second, providing practical advice to scientists
   regarding what practitioners seek from research.Social implications -
   The work will contribute to improving how Norwegian municipalities
   consider and address extreme weather, in the context of climate change
   amongst other hazards, along with further social and environmental
   changes affecting municipalities.Originality/value - This special issue
   represents an interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral approach towards useable
   science. It is also relatively original in providing an
   interdisciplinary approach for the case study of Norway.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>A spatially based decision support system developed for use in guiding
   investment by Catchment Management Authorities (SCaRPA - Site and
   Catchment Resource Planning and Assessment) has been trialled during the
   past three years with the Murrumbidgee Catchment Management Authority in
   NSW. Software was developed in a project funded by the National Action
   Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and the Natural Heritage Trust by
   researchers from government agencies in NSW and CSIRO and is designed to
   be used in conjunction with existing CMA business systems. The system
   supports the development of catchment scale investment priority models
   for single or multiple environmental assets developed through a
   consultative process with CMA and expert agency staff. Catchment
   priority models facilitate true integrated catchment management by
   informing the development of strategic catchment plans, as well as
   providing inputs to assessment of proposals for action at a site level.
   The project with Murrumbidgee CMA was supported by the compilation of a
   new vegetation map for the region to enable modelling of priority
   surfaces for biodiversity conservation, as well as enhanced priority
   models for water quality, salinity mitigation, afforestation and
   cultural heritage protection (not shown in this paper). Major
   'Ecotender' market-based programs were run throughout the catchment
   using the system but this paper will focus on the 2010/11 stewardship
   program to protect and enhance native vegetation in strategic climate
   change corridors. The software and overall approach proved effective in
   achieving well-targeted and cost-effective programs for natural resource
   management. A budget of $1.5M was allocated for a 'Climate Change
   Corridors' program with 76 project proposals received. These were
   initially assessed based on catchment priority models to reduce the
   applications down to 55 for site assessment. (The cost for assessment
   rapidly increases once site assessments have to be made). Of the 55 Site
   assessments 21 proposals for funding were offered as the best return on
   investment within the program budget. Success for adoption of this
   project is related to the CMAs' ownership of every stage in the project
   development process. They have the flexibility to use their own data and
   build priority models within a decision support system that allows

   activities to our planet (e. g. deforestation, urban growth). It can
   provide measurements supporting the process of sustainable development,
   or observations allowing the detection of changes in the surface of our
   planet related to climate change. UNESCO and ESA have launched a call to
   all national and international space agencies, space research
   institutions and universities to make use of space technologies in order
   to assist developing countries in the monitoring of the World Heritage
   sites.ESA and UNESCO are also covering associated educational aspects by
   using all the results of the projects under implementation as
   educational material to support UNESCO's 'UN decade for education and
   sustainable development', within a common and joint strategy of
   education, targeting schools, universities and young professionals. This
   includes creating new tools for the creation of awareness and
   savoir-faire in the use of space technology for the conservation and
   preservation of the environment and for a sustainable
   development.Material derived from satellite images provided to decision
   makers is also being used to support teachers and school children from
   the surroundings of the World Heritage sites where the space partners of
   the 'Open Initiative' are working. In the frame of its educational
   activities for Earth Observation, ESA is creating particular modules
   oriented to UNESCO sites. All this material comes out of the different
   activities being implemented by partners of the ESA UNESCO 'Open
   Initiative', in complete integration with the EDUSPACE programme of ESA,
   a platform and webbased tool for Earth Observation Education, in eight
   different languages, available for free to worldwide secondary schools
   teachers and students, aiming to provide schools with tools for teaching
   and learning. It offers an entry point to Earth Observation satellite
   data and software applications for training. The website is host to a
   multitude of didactical material inclusive high-resolution local and
   lower resolution global remote sensing satellite data in order to show
   students how to study the planet as a whole from space as well as the
   possibility of zooming into specific areas and natural features to
   investigate their behaviour over space and time. An image processing
   tool called LEOWorks (Learning Earth Observation), including a GIS, soon
   in open source, is made available for data analysis and image
   interpretation. New dedicated content, like case studies and projects
   dedicated to the monitoring of UNESCO archaeological sites and to
   sustainable development are presently under development.</td>

   Pakistan indicated a rise in temperature ranging from 0.1 to 0.2 degrees
   C per decade while the change in precipitation from 1.0 to 1.5% per
   decade was observed for most of the regions. A varietals field
   experiment was conducted at different locations (arid and semi arid) of
   Punjab-Pakistan. Experiment was laid out in RCBD, with four replications
   with four wheat varieties. Field data was used to check the capacity of
   CERES-Wheat for crop growth and yield simulations under different
   environments. Under the semi arid conditions, the model simulated
   phenology fairly with error ranging from 7.31 to 15.60 % in days to
   flowering and 5 to 38 % in days to physiological maturity. The seasonal
   dynamics of LAI were acceptably simulated by the model. The model
   predictions of grain yield were very close to the observed values with
   error ranging from 0.36 to 3.13%. Over all results showed that model can
   simulate crop growth parameters as well as yield components fairly well.
   It can be concluded that selection of suitable cultivar could enhance
   our yield.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>The phenomenon of the abandonment of terraced landscapes compromises
   environmental well-being and is a preamble to hydrological instability
   and, consequently, the collapse of terrace retaining walls, soil
   erosion, and loss of agricultural lands. These problems will escalate in
   the coming years because of climate change (CC), especially in areas in
   which a rise in rainfall events is expected, such as the coastline of
   the Campania region, which is exposed to extreme rainfall events. This
   study identifies a landscape management guideline for Crapolla Fiord on
   the Amalfi coast (Campania region), a typical cultural landscape
   characterized by the presence of archaeological ruins. Potential hazards
   were evaluated and quantified, taking into account the flow rate and the
   rain intensity both at the mountainside and microbasin scale. This study
   shows that potential hazards have increased because of the loss of
   terraces and may further increase due to the abandonment of agriculture.
   This paper points out that supporting measures are necessary in areas in
   which agricultural land use is still present and that the introduction
   of small interventions designed to raise the infiltration capacity of
   the soil and/or to regenerate vegetation in areas in which terraces have
   been lost is a best practice.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Today, many older coastal, riverine, and deltaic communities are faced
   with increasing flood risk, often combined with a rise in sea levels or
   land erosion. Until now, the options available to owners of heritage
   properties have been limited. Buoyant foundation retrofits offer
   under-resourced communities a viable and affordable adaptation
   alternative to buy-outs, tear-downs, and "displacement by climate
   change". Amphibious strategies will not solve all challenges related to
   the increased impacts of climate change on heritage architecture, but
   offer a resilient option for communities to protect their physical
   history and cultural identity. This paper will provide an overview of
   amphibious retrofit construction and its application to the preservation
   of historic buildings and neighborhoods. It will provide several case
   study examples, namely, retrofits of heritage buildings in the
   historically significant African-American community of Princeville,
   North Carolina; for a low-income neighborhood of freedman's cottages in
   Charleston, South Carolina; and a creative approach for amphibiating
   architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's iconic Farnsworth House in Plano,
   Illinois. It will connect to larger themes of developing innovative and
   practical methods for providing flood protection to heritage structures,
   using an approach that emphasizes sensitivity and adaptability to the
   cultural values of existing communities.</td>

   areas. This study applies two well-known models - the information value
   model (IVM) and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model, and two additional
   models - a biological climatic (Bioclim) model and a mean distance
   (Domain) model, to evaluate the landslide susceptibility of the Honghe
   Hani Rice Terraces, a World Heritage site in Yuanyang County of
   Southwest China. A spatial dataset comprising 235 historical landslide
   locations were used in the models at a training-to-testing data ratio of
   75:25. Fifteen commonly used environmental, geological, and
   meteorological factors, as well as three new factors including proximity
   to settlements, human activity intensity, and the multi-year average
   temperature were selected as the impacting factors to landslide
   occurance. Model validation and comparison were performed using the area
   under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and several
   statistical indices (sensibility, specificity, accuracy, precision,
   recall, true skill statistic or TSS, F-measure). The results show that
   the MaxEnt model yields the best overall performance for landslide
   susceptibility analysis, followed by the Domain model, IVM, and the
   Bioclim model. The jackknife test result shows that the three most
   important factors contributing to landslide hazard include proximity to
   roads, annual rainfall, and proximity to settlements. Furthermore, only
   a small proportion of areas positioned along roads were identified to be
   at high or very high risk for landslides given the fact the study site
   is located in a remote and mountainous region with under-developed
   economy in southwest China. Findings from this study can be used to
   facilitate landslide risk mitigation and the sustainable conservation of
   the Honghe Hani Rice Terrace World Heritage site or other similar areas.</td>

   genetic structure, species divergence and demographic history of two QTP
   endemic species, Juniperus erectopatens and J. microsperma as well as
   their close relatives, J. sabina and J. semiglobosa. Furthermore, we
   assessed the correlation between their divergence and the historical
   environmental changes of the QTP. *BEAST analysis revealed that a clade
   containing J. erectopatens and J. microsperma separated from the clade
   containing J. sabina and J. semiglobosa about 2.72 million years ago
   (Mya), whereas the divergence between J. erectopatens and J. microsperma
   occurred 0.64 Mya. In contrast, the Isolation and Migration model
   suggested that J. erectopatens diverged from J. microsperma due to
   geographic isolation during the early to middle Pleistocene about 1.24
   Mya, which corresponds to the Quaternary climate oscillations.
   Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) suggested that J. erectopatens
   underwent a population expansion 726 thousand years ago (Kya) followed
   by a decline 188 Kya. These results suggest that the Quaternary climate
   oscillations had a profound impact on the demographic history of the QTP
   endemic J. erectopatens as well as on the divergence between J.
   erectopatens and J. microsperma. Furthermore, they suggest that some QTP
   endemic woody species might be younger than previously thought.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Background Understanding the origin of genetic variation is the key to
   predict how species will respond to future climate change. The genus
   Quercus is a species-rich and ecologically diverse woody genus that
   dominates a wide range of forests and woodland communities of the
   Northern Hemisphere. Quercus thus offers a unique opportunity to
   investigate how adaptation to environmental changes has shaped the
   spatial genetic structure of closely related lineages. Furthermore,
   Quercus provides a deep insight into how tree species will respond to
   future climate change. This study investigated whether closely related
   Quercus lineages have similar spatial genetic structures and moreover,
   what roles have their geographic distribution, ecological tolerance, and
   historical environmental changes played in the similar or distinct
   genetic structures. Results Despite their close relationships, the three
   main oak lineages (Quercus sections Cyclobalanopsis, Ilex, and Quercus)
   have different spatial genetic patterns and occupy different climatic
   niches. The lowest level and most homogeneous pattern of genetic
   diversity was found in section Cyclobalanopsis, which is restricted to
   warm and humid climates. The highest genetic diversity and strongest
   geographic genetic structure were found in section Ilex, which is due to
   their long-term isolation and strong local adaptation. The widespread
   section Quercus is distributed across the most heterogeneous range of
   environments; however, it exhibited moderate haplotype diversity. This
   is likely due to regional extinction during Quaternary climatic
   fluctuation in Europe and North America. Conclusions Genetic variations
   of sections Ilex and Quercus were significantly predicted by geographic
   and climate variations, while those of section Cyclobalanopsis were
   poorly predictable by geographic or climatic diversity. Apart from the
   different historical environmental changes experienced by different
   sections, variation of their ecological or climatic tolerances and
   physiological traits induced varying responses to similar environment
   changes, resulting in distinct spatial genetic patterns.</td>

   phenomenon due to the different tourist's needs and to the specific

   Consequently, a unique tourism development strategy cannot be defined
   and adopted anywhere. When considering tourism-based territorial
   development in mountain areas, it is crucial to take the vision of local

   opinions towards shared tools, this study analyses the local
   stakeholder's point of view using a mixed method consisting of a Delphi
   method followed by a Group Nominal Technique. The research was performed
   in Soana Valley, a small mountain community in the Northwestern Italian
   Alps. It involved 17 local stakeholders divided into three main
   groups-local administrators (n = 3), hospitality operators (9) and
   retailers (5). Results show how operators converge on three common
   aspects-local food product offering, territorial promotion and
   collaboration among operators, on which the community should focus to

   important archaeological monuments in Peru and worldwide. Machu Picchu
   is classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site and at risk from climatic
   change. However, the seismic centennial history of Peru reports large
   earthquakes generated both along the subduction zone (Mw8) and on active
   crustal faults along the Andean Cordillera (Mw7). It is therefore
   important to know if Machu Picchu is located in an area of seismic
   hazard and then to take measures to mitigate potential seismic hazards.
   Due to the short historical earthquake catalogue (&lt; 500 years) and the
   absence of significant recent instrumental seismicity in the site's
   vicinity (radius of &lt; 30 km), our knowledge about the seismic hazard in
   Machu Picchu is limited. The earthquakes of 1650 and 1950 affected Cusco
   city and surrounding areas, but without damage descriptions in Machu
   Picchu (80 km away) (Silgado Ferro 1978). In this study, we make the
   first attempt to use the analysis of earthquake archaeological effects
   (EAEs) and their differentiation from the effects generated by slope
   movements (creep) to investigate the past occurrence of strong
   earthquakes at the site. The application of geological structural
   analysis to the deformations observed in Machu Picchu shows two
   directions of the mean ground movement: N020 degrees E and N110 degrees
   E. Two earthquakes that affected Machu Picchu during its construction
   generated these directions. This kind of data should be used in the
   future to protect this important archaeological site.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Purpose The improper management of conventional systems for recording,
   diagnosing and analysing information appears to be a major problem in
   the maintenance of heritage buildings. This is because of a lack of
   detection of patent or latent defects, ineffective repair methods and
   inappropriate planning decisions, which increase the risks of failure
   throughout the lifetime of heritage buildings. The paper aims to discuss
   this issue. Design/methodology/approach The concept of maintenance
   management practices, as well as techniques and tools from information
   and communication technology, was reviewed to identify suitable
   processes and construct an information database of maintenance and
   management techniques. A maintenance index framework was then formulated
   by analysing these concepts. Findings The initial findings identify the
   need for decision-making support in the diagnosis of heritage building
   maintenance based on robust data collection. This should include the
   selection of a durable replacement design and material or an appropriate
   rehabilitation method for managing quality and reducing associated
   defects. Originality/value Further research into the maintenance of
   heritage buildings should consider various aspects in terms of
   sustainability. The paper concludes that implementing a maintenance
   index framework can help improve the decision-making performance with
   regard to the design, construction and maintenance operations of
   heritage concrete buildings.</td>

   to dwellers in outdoors but also to preserve cultural heritage
   masterpieces for tourism and local socio-cultural identity. This work
   couples an innovative field monitoring at multiple scales and a
   validated numerical modelling effort to identify indoor and outdoor
   critical conditions at the present time and in the future, according to
   IPCC climate change forecast scenarios. The authors focused the
   attention on the overheating risk of Gubbio historical city center, in
   central Italy. Experimental data analysis highlights the microclimate
   granularity of the case study with detected temperature discrepancies up
   to 2.5 &deg;C observed at pedestrian height during the hottest hour, i.e.
   2p.m. Collected data are then used to validate the numerical models of
   (i) the most significant building of the city and (ii) its surroundings
   to investigate indoor/outdoor thermal comfort stress due to climate
   change and local overheating. The combined analysis shows that indoor
   operative temperature reaches 32 &deg;C on average in 80 years, compared to
   the current 29 &deg;C value. In the outdoors, apparent temperature increases
   by about 10 &deg;C on 2100, being responsible for a serious threat
   compromising socio-cultural life, human health and outdoor and
   recreational activities.</td>

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Anthropogenic damage of geoheritage is documented widely, but natural
   processes can also lead to geoheritage loss. For instance, sand dune
   migration causes submergence of unique geological and palaeontological
   sites in desert environments of the Sahara. The Siwa Oasis in the
   Western Desert of Egypt boasts rich geoheritage, which is represented in
   many localities. Three of them in the southern part of the oasis are
   outcrops of highly-fossiliferous limestones. Palaeontological,
   sedimentary, palaeogeographical, and geomorphological types of
   geoheritage are recognized there. Sand dune activity on the study area
   is registered both visually and with remote sensing techniques.
   Denudation and destruction of naturally-exposed rocks is documented.
   Evidence of outcrop submergence with sand is found in all cases. The
   localities are situated in the pathway of rapid (up to (similar to)10
   m/yr) dune migration. One locality may disappear within one-two years.
   Sand dune migration has to be considered as a factor of geoheritage loss
   in the Siwa Oasis, and the relevant protection of the studied localities
   is necessary. Geopark creation and improvement of water use in the oasis
   can also help significantly, as well as the reference to archaeological
   experience of excavation and protection of heritage sites submerged by
   sands. More generally, geoheritage conservation should be integrated
   with a program for sustainable oasis development. (C) 2019 The

<td valign="top">AB </td><td>Climate change affects, directly and indirectly, the tangible and
   intangible features of heritage sites. Conservation studies often
   examine the impacts of climate change on heritage sites by assuming it
   as an isolated and static concept. This study aims to debate cultural
   heritage concept as the primary and neglected factor for wise
   development of climate-resilience policies. We first adopt the
   qualitative Meta-synthesis method to analyze the impacts of climate
   change on world heritage sites, through a systematic review of reports
   published by the UNESCO and its advisory bodies. Then, it is explained
   why the sustainability of cultural heritage requires a fundamental
   reconsideration of the concept and promotion of its evaluation
   framework. The findings suggest that protection of cultural heritage and
   developing the climate-resilience policies for the sustainability of
   landscape requires at the early stages a reflection on how heritage is
   defined as a useful resource and acceptable characteristic of territory.</td>
